The purpose of study in physics is to obtain an understanding of the nature and order of the physical world while being exposed to the logical application of scientific methods in discovering this order. This study is recommended for physics majors and minors as preparation for graduate school, secondary-level teaching, or other employment, and for chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science, and pre-medical students to supplement and complement their major fields of study. Students considering a career in secondary education may wish to pursue the physical science major, which is designed more to their needs.

The Exercise Science major provides a mixture of laboratory courses and practical experiences preparing students to understand and apply scientific principles to human movement. Students prepare for careers in fitness training, wellness, adult fitness/cardiac rehab, strength and conditioning of athletes, clinical exercise physiology, and scientific research. Students are required to perform a minimum of 120 hours of practical experience through leadership in campus-based exercise and human performance testing, and an off-campus internship.

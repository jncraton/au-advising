## Public Health Major (48-51 hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Anderson University Public Health program addresses the health of populations and communities through instruction, service-learning, and community-based research, and is grounded in a background of humanities, social sciences, and the liberal arts. The public health program is designed to provide students with the opportunity to explore and acquire specialized knowledge and skills needed to address current and emerging public health issues within the public and private healthcare sectors. Students can expect to find employment in for-profit institutions, not-for-profit institutions, health care organizations, and government agencies.

This interdisciplinary program will offer two pathways. The first will be a Bachelor of Arts in Public Health (BAPH) with a concentration in the Sociological and Behavioral Context of Health. This track will appeal to those students who are seeking to focus on the socio-behavioral, socio-economic, and health systems contexts that impact public health. Graduates can expect to be employed in areas such as behavioral health, psychology, missions, health promotion and education, health policy and administration, and social marketing.

The second pathway will be in the natural sciences, offering a Bachelor of Science in Public Health degree (BSPH).  This track is for students wanting to engage in public health practice through research, epidemiology, or environmental services. Graduates from this track will be prepared for jobs such as data analysts, biostaticians, environmental/sanitation specialists, epidemiologists, missions, health promotion and education, medicine, and research. Students interested in the BSPH track will receive a board-based natural science curriculum.

For entry and continuance in the public health program, all students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. To advance, a minimum grade of C or better must be earned in each public health course, as well as the courses upon which they build in each concentration (BA: SOCI 2020, SOWK 2000; BS: BIOL 2410, 2420, 2230).

## Biology Major (48 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Through the integration of faith and learning, the Department of Biology strives to give students a breadth of foundational knowledge that will serve them, whether they plan to teach or to continue their own education in medical or dental school or other graduate degree programs. The biology department is dedicated to providing students with a well-rounded background in the field of biology. Students can concentrate their studies in various areas of biology by taking courses such as anatomy, physiology, histology, mammalian physiology, molecular biology, plant science, and environmental ecology.

If continuing to medical school, graduate school, or pursuing an industry career the student should speak with a Biology advisor for additional recommended classes.

## Major Requirements:

BIOL 2230, 3800, and 4700 do not apply toward the major.

## 28 credit hours from:

- BIOL 2210, Foundations of Modern Biology I, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 2220, Foundations of Modern Biology II, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 2240, Cell Biology, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 3030, Microbiology, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 3510, Bioethics OR BIOL 3920, Integration of Faith and Science, 2 credit hours
- BIOL 4050, Genetics, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 4070, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 4910, Science Seminar I, 1 credit hour
- BIOL 4920, Science Seminar II, 1 credit hour

## 8 credit of upper-division BIOL courses:

- Completion of both BIOL 2410 and 2420 will substitute for 4 credit hours of upper division biology
- CHEM 2110, General Chemistry I, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 2120, General Chemistry II, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 2210, Organic Chemistry I, 4 credit hours
- At least one course from CHEM 2120, 2220, 3100

Additional CHEM courses, especially CHEM 2220 and 3100 are strongly recommended.

If continuing to medical or graduate school, or pursuing an industry career, the student should speak with a Biology advisor for additional recommended classes.

NOTE: All students must complete 120 total credit hours to graduate from Anderson University.

The study of chemistry introduces students to the world of atoms and molecules and their composition and interactions. This study is recommended for chemistry majors and minors as preparation for graduate school, medical school, secondary-level teaching, or careers in government or industrial laboratories. It is also recommended for physics or biology students to supplement and complement their major fields of study.

Among the CHEM Electives (3000 or higher), students must take CHEM 4110 or CHEM 4120.

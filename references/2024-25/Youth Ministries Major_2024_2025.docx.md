## Youth Ministries Major (49 credit hours)

2024-2025

Youth Ministries is a stand-alone major that prepares students for ministry to youth, including church-based youth and children's ministries, youth camps, urban ministries, or other settings. The major is strongly rooted in Bible and ministry courses, which prepares students not only for immediate ministry work, but also for further graduate theological education.

The Youth Ministries Major is also available as a 4+1 option where students can complete both the Bachelor's degree in Youth Ministry as well as an MDIV in 5 years. Please contact the department for more information on the 4+1, or look at the Christian Ministries 4+1 Advising sheet as an example.

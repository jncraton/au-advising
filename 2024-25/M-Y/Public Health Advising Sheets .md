## Public Health Major (50-53 hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Anderson University Public Health program is an intentional response to address the growing need for public health practitioners who are highly competent, innovative, and compassionate, and committed to excellence in the work of promoting health, improving the health and wellbeing of vulnerable and underserved populations globally.

The mission of the public health program is:

To prepare students who will become the hands, feet, and voice of Christ in the work of preventing disease, promoting health and wellness, and facilitating experiences of hope in vulnerable and underserved populations globally.

The vision of the public health program is:

We envision teams of faithful, compassionate, innovative, and competent ambassadors for Christ engaged in the work of bringing hope and healing to vulnerable and underserved people and communities globally.

While the public health program's mission, purpose, and vision provide the foundation upon which the curriculum is developed, the following nine (9) core values guide the program's academic strategies.

- (1.) An intellectually informed faith, (2.) imagination and creativity, (3.) servant leadership, (4.) excellence, (5.) integrity and character, (6.) integrative learning, (7.) Christian worldview, (8.) transformative action, and (9.) stewardship of gifts.

This interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary design of the public health curriculum exposes students to faculty members and students from various academic disciplines, as a result, it facilitates the development of proficiency in understanding the complex nature of public health issues and challenges, and how to address them and engage in transformative actions.

The public health program offers two (2) academic tracks, and is grounded in a background of Humanities, Social Science, and the Liberal Arts. The first track is the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health (BAPH) with a concentration in the Sociological and Behavioral Context of Health. This track appeals to students seeking to focus on the socio-behavioral, socio-economic, and health systems contexts that impact public health. The second track is the Bachelor of Science (BSPH). This track is designed for students who desire to engage in public health practice through research, epidemiology, or environmental services. Graduates from the program will be prepared for jobs such as data analysts, biostatisticians, environmental/sanitary specialists, epidemiologists, faith-based missions specialists, health promotion and education specialists, and research.

For entry and continuance in the public health program, all students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. To advance, a minimum grade of C or better must be earned in each public health course, as well as the courses upon which they build in each concentration (BA: SOCI 2020, SOCI 2100; BS: BIOL 2410, 2420, 2230).

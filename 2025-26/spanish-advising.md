A major in Spanish offers students a triple focus: language, culture, and literature. After successful completion, majors will be equipped to comprehend and interpret written and spoken language, express themselves in the written and spoken word of that language, have a fundamental understanding of the literature and civilizations of the countries represented by their target language, and value other cultures as responsible global citizens. Students are prepared linguistically for graduate study as well as careers in areas such as-but not limited to-business,  comparative literature, education, film, law, health care, social services, missionary service, journalism, law enforcement, or public service.

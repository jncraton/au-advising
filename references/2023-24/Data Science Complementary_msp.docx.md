## Data Science Complementary Major (34-36 credit hours)

A complementary major in data science prepares graduates to apply the techniques of data science to the area of their primary major. Graduates of this program will have developed an intuition for discovering meaning in data and will have the skills needed to provide value and purpose in the field of their primary major.

## Major Requirements:

## Data Science Core (24 hours):

- MATH 2120, Statistics, 4 credit hours
- POSC 2420, Applied Statistics Lab, 1 credit hour
- CPSC 2020, Fundamentals of Computational Thinking and Programing, 4 credit hours 1
- CPSC 2030, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, 4 credit hours
- CPSC 2040, Introduction to Data Science, 3 credit hours
- CPSC 2100, Database Programming, 4 credit hours
- CPSC 4100, Advanced Databases and Big Data Analytics, 4 credit hours

## Data Science Elective (4 hours):

- Any computer science course numbered greater than CPSC 3000

## Communication Elective (3-4 hours):

One course from:

- ARTS 2100, Introduction to Graphic Design
- COMM 2200, Visual Communication
- ENGL 3140, Writing and Digital Media
- ENGL 3160, Professional Writing and Editing
- or another communications elective approved by the data science advisor

## Domain Elective (3-4 hours):

A major in data science also requires a major or minor in an application domain, as approved by a data science advisor. Suggested minors include: Accounting, Biology, Chemistry, Criminal Justice, Marketing, Management, Physics, Psychology, Social Media, and Sports Marketing.

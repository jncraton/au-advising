## Undergraduate Policy of Satisfactory Academic Progress Anderson University

<!-- image -->

Federal regulations mandate that colleges and universities establish and publish satisfactory academic progress standards for students who receive federal financial aid. The Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE), along with other states, requires colleges and universities to use the same policy the college or university establishes for the administration of federal aid in the administration of Indiana and other state aid programs. Therefore, to maintain a consistent policy for all students receiving financial assistance, Anderson University has adopted these same standards in the administration of all institutionally awarded funds.

The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships may change this policy at any time to ensure continued compliance with changes in federal and state regulations regarding student financial aid. The Director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is responsible for interpreting and enforcing this policy. Questions concerning the University's policy of Satisfactory Academic Progress should be addressed to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at the contact information below:

## Semester Review

A review of students' Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) status will be made at the end of each semester, including a summer term if the student is enrolled in a summer term. A student's SAP status is determined by a qualitative standard (GPA), a quantitative standard (number of attempted/earned hours), and maximum timeframe (not to exceed 150 percent of the number of hours required for the degree). All terms are factored into each component of SAP, including terms in which the student did not receive aid.

## Minimum Number of Earned Hours Required ( Quantitative )

Students are eligible to receive financial aid, provided all other requirements of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy have been met, so long as they earn at least 67 percent of attempted hours. Students who do not earn at least 67 percent of their attempted hours will be placed on a 'Warning' status for financial aid. Students on a Warning status must meet SAP eligibility requirements by the end of the following semester. If SAP eligibility requirements are not met at the end of the following semester, the student will be denied their eligibility for financial aid. (See Financial Aid Appeals below). Withdrawn classes in which students receive a grade of 'W' (withdraw), repeated classes, classes in which they have Incompletes (I), and transfer credits are all considered attempted hours.  Any Incomplete (I) that is changed to another grade will be reviewed at the next semester review.

## Maximum number of attempted hours allowed ( Maximum Timeframe )

Students are eligible to receive financial aid, provided all other requirements of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy have been met, so long as the number of attempted hours does not exceed 150 percent of the number of hours required for their degree. Transfer hours that apply towards the degree will be considered as attempted hours. Once a student's number of attempted hours exceeds 150 percent of the number of hours required for their degree, or if it is no longer mathematically possible for the student to complete their degree within the maximum number of attempted hours allowed, the student will be denied eligibility for financial aid. (See Financial Aid Appeals below).

Example: The Bachelor of Arts degree requires a student to complete at least 120 credit hours. A student may attempt no more than 180 hours (120 times 150%) and remain eligible to receive financial aid.

## Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average required (Qualitative)

Students are eligible to receive financial aid, provided all other requirements of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy have been met, so long as they maintain the minimum cumulative GPA as listed below. Students who fall below the minimum cumulative GPA will be placed on a 'Warning' status for financial aid. Students on a Warning status must increase their cumulative GPA to meet SAP eligibility requirements by the end of the following semester. If SAP eligibility requirements are not met at the end of the following semester, the student will be denied their eligibility for financial aid. (See Financial Aid Appeals below).  Withdrawn classes and transfer credits are not used in the determination of the student's grade point average. Repeated classes and Incompletes will be used in the determination of the grade point average.  Any Incomplete (I) that is changed to another grade will be reviewed at the next semester review.

## Hours Earned Minimum Cumulative GPA

1-29 completed credit hours = 1.60 minimum GPA 30-59 hours completed credit hours = 1.80 minimum GPA 60 or more completed credit hours = 2.00 minimum GPA

## Reinstatement of Eligibility

Students who fail to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress are not eligible to receive financial aid but are eligible for reinstatement of their financial aid following the completion of at least twelve (12) credit hours and by earning at least a 2.0 GPA for those hours. Such coursework can be completed at any accredited college or university. To request reinstatement of eligibility students will be required to submit a copy of their most recent transcript which shows the completion of at least twelve (12) credit hours with at least a 2.0 GPA along with an approved academic plan.

## Financial Aid Appeal

A student may appeal under any condition that constitutes an extenuating and/or mitigating circumstance and where such circumstances contributed to their failure to meet the university's standard of satisfactory academic progress.

An 'extenuating circumstance' is defined as an undue, temporary hardship that has a direct causal link between the circumstance and the student's poor academic performance. Examples of extenuating circumstances that would be considered for a SAP appeal include, but are not limited to, the following: death of a family member, severe personal injury or illness of the student, divorce, victimization of a violent crime or natural disaster, etc. A lack of focus or balance of work/school/life responsibilities does not constitute an extenuating circumstance.

## Required documentation of an appeal

- SAP Appeal Request Form - may be obtained from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships office by emailing finaid@anderson.edu.
- A typed, one-page letter - The letter should explain the circumstances that caused the student to fail SAP and any attached documentation (see below) supporting the extenuating circumstances. The letter should also include what changes have occurred in the student's life, such that the extenuating circumstances are no longer a hindrance to the student's academic performance.

- Documentation - Any documentation that directly relates to the student's problem semester and supports the information provided in the student's submitted letter should be submitted. Examples of supporting documentation include copies of obituaries or death certificates, medical documentation, statements from employers on company letterhead describing the student's situation (should also include contact information), copies of police reports, etc.
- Academic Plan An approved academic plan will be required as a condition of the appeal. The student's academic plan must be developed by meeting with their faculty academic advisor and will need the endorsement of their faculty academic advisor or by the Director of Educational Support Services. Academic plans should follow the worksheet provided by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships
- Unofficial AU transcript - may be obtained by contacting the Registrar's Office or through AccessAU.

Appeals must be submitted with all the required documentation listed above. Appeals missing even one required document are incomplete and will not be considered for an appeal.

## Deadline for appeals

Students are strongly encouraged to appeal early. Students must submit their written appeal prior to the second Friday of the term for which they have lost their financial aid eligibility.

## Approved Appeals

Students who successfully appeal their failed SAP status will be placed in a financial aid 'Appeal' status. Students in an Appeal status are eligible to receive financial aid but must meet all measures set forth in their approved academic plan developed with their advisor and submitted as a part of the appeal process to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. Students on an Appeal status must meet SAP by the end of the next term. Appeal status may be terminated by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships if a student does not follow the approved Academic Plan, including if the student withdraws from any courses during an appeal period. Should extenuating circumstances occur that prohibit a student from being able to follow their academic plan, the student may submit, in consultation with and under the approval of their faculty academic advisor, a new academic plan to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. Students who fail to meet either the university's standards of satisfactory academic progress or the minimum requirements as called for in their academic plan will be, again, denied eligibility for financial aid.

## Denied Appeals

Students whose appeal was not approved may request an additional review by making such a request in writing to the Director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. In making a request for an additional review, the student will be given the opportunity to submit additional relevant information regarding their appeal. Also, see Reinstatement of Eligibility below. The decision of the Director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships will be final.

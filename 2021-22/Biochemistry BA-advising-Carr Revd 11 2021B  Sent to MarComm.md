## Biochemistry Major, Bachelor of Arts (56 credit hours)

The Biochemistry major is an interdisciplinary major that applies the principles and methods of both biology and chemistry to understanding the molecular basis of life. The major requires a number of basic classes from each discipline  with  advanced  courses  in  chemical  instrumentation,  cell  and  molecular  biology,  genetics,  and biochemistry, and allows the student to select additional courses necessary to pursue certain career objectives.

## Major Requirements:

BIOL 1000, 2230, 3800, and 4700 do not apply toward the major CHEM 1000 and 2700 do not apply toward the major

## Civil Engineering Major Bachelor of Science (92 credit hours)

Civil engineering is for students interested in solving engineering problems around public infrastructure, including roads, bridges, dams, levees, and construction projects. These students will be involved in big projects that will get them out in the field, interacting with construction managers, surveyors, and contractors. Students will experience a wide range of topics in structural analysis and design, water resources and design, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, and surveying, with plenty of hands-on laboratory experiences.

## Youth Leadership Complementary Major (28 credit hours)

## AcademicAdvising

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The complementary major does not stand alone to fulfill graduation requirements, but it is a valuable complement to such majors as youth ministries, sociology, social work, criminal justice, psychology, and other majors involving interaction with youth. This major is also an excellent complement for students who enjoy working with youth but whose careers will be in fields that may not involve interaction with youth.

The youth leadership major is part of the Department of Psychology and provides students with the training to help youth develop the knowledge and skills needed for social interactions, such as assertiveness training, building and maintaining healthy relationships, and developing effective communication techniques. It is a complementary major that can be paired with another major relevant to a student's career desires.

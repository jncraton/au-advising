Elementary Education Major (127 credit hours upon degree completion, including 12 in supportive disciplines, 14 in partial fulfillment of the liberal arts program, and 25 additional liberal arts credits outside of the major)

The elementary education major prepares candidates to teach kindergarten through grade 6 in the general elementary classroom. All elementary education candidates earn embedded concentrations in Reading K-6 and Special Education K-6 with either serving as the required concentration for state licensure. The reading concentration does not provide an additional licensing area; however, it does signify that a candidate has received extra coursework and field experiences in designing effective reading instruction. The special education concentration may provide an additional licensing area in Mild Intervention (Grades K-6) for candidates who pass the corresponding licensure examination and complete student teaching with a focus on both general and special education students and classroom settings. Both concentrations will be printed on their license in addition to Elementary Education K-6.

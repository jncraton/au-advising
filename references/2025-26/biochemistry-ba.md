## Biochemistry Major (56 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Biochemistry major is an interdisciplinary major that applies the principles and methods of both biology and chemistry to understanding the molecular basis of life. The major requires a number of basic classes from each discipline with advanced courses in chemical instrumentation, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry, and allows the student to select additional courses necessary to pursue certain career objectives.

## Major Requirements:

- BIOL 2210, Foundations of Modern Biology I, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 2220, Foundations of Modern Biology II, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 2240, Cell Biology, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 4050, Genetics, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 4310, Molecular Biochemistry and Genetics, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 2110, General Chemistry I, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 2120, General Chemistry II, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 2210, Organic Chemistry I, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 2220, Organic Chemistry II, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 3100, Analytical Chemistry, 4 credit hours
- CHEM 4510, Senior Physical Science Practicum I, 1 credit hour
- CHEM 4520, Senior Physical Science Practicum II, 1 credit hour
- BIOL/CHEM 4210, Biochemistry I, 4 credit hours
- BIOL/CHEM 4220, Biochemistry II, 4 credit hours
- BIOL/CHEM/PHYS 4910, Science Seminar I, 1 credit hour

## Elective hours from:

- CHEM 3140, 4090, 4110
- BIOL 3030, 4120

It is suggested that students pursuing pre-medicine should elect BIOL 3030, 4120. They should also take PHYS 2140, 2150 or MATH 2010, 2020, PHYS 2240, 2250.

It is suggested that students pursuing graduate school should elect CHEM 3140, 4090, 4110; BIOL 3030. They should also take MATH 2010, 2020 and PHYS 2240, 2250.

It is suggested that students pursuing an industry career should elect CHEM 3140.

- BIOL 2210, Foundations of Modern Biology I, is a Scientific Ways of Knowing course in the Liberal Arts Program.
- CHEM 2110, General Chemistry I, is a Scientific Ways of Knowing course in the Liberal Arts Program.

NOTE: All students must complete 120 total credit hours to graduate from Anderson University.

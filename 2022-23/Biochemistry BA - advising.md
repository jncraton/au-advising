## Biochemistry Major (56 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Biochemistry major is an interdisciplinary major that applies the principles and methods of both biology and chemistry to understanding the molecular basis of life. The major requires a number of basic classes form each discipline with advanced courses in chemical instrumentation, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry, and allows the student to select additional courses necessary to pursue certain career objectives.

## Major Requirements:

- BIOL 2210, Foundations of Modern Biology I, 4 credit hours
- BIOL 2220, Foundations of Modern Biology II, 4 credit hours

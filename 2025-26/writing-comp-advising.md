The writing complementary major is designed to allow students to emphasize either creative writing or non-creative writing in conjunction with another major, especially those fields which include challenging writing tasks. The major requires the student to complete 18-20 hours of course credit in the department's upper-division writing courses and to earn 6-8 hours of credit from among seven participating literature options.

It is a 27-hour complementary major, which means that the student's other major(s) must be pursued outside of the English department.  It may complement any other major, but especially those fields which include challenging writing tasks.

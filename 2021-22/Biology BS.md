## Biology Major Bachelor of Science (72 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Through the integration of faith and learning, the Department of Biology strives to give students a breadth of foundational knowledge that will serve them, whether they plan to teach or to continue their own education in medical or dental school or other graduate degree programs. The biology department is dedicated to providing students with a well-rounded background in the field of biology. Students can concentrate their studies in various areas of biology by taking courses such as anatomy, physiology, histology, mammalian physiology, molecular biology, plant science, and environmental ecology.

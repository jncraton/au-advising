The music education major provides students with the musical knowledge and pedagogical skills needed for a career in teaching choral and instrumental music in grades K-12. Students who complete this program are licensed by the state of Indiana to teach music. They are highly effective at teaching musical concepts and at conducting and rehearsing musical ensembles to prepare them for performances. Music education majors gain performance experience through ensemble participation, private music study, and recital preparation. These students develop portfolios and interviewing skills to assist them as they transition from college to professional teaching.

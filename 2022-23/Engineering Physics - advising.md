## Engineering Physics Bachelor of Science (76 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Students studying Engineering Physics can usually fall into two categories, those wishing to pursue a graduate degree in physics or engineering, or those with a passion for physics and research and want a strong background in hardware and design.

These students will often go on to graduate school but are also exceptionally well prepared for careers in industry and national laboratories.

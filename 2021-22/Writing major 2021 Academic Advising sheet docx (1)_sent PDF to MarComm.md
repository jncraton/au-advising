## Writing Major (35 credit hours)

The Writing major provides the student with opportunities to develop advanced writing competencies in a range of creative and professional writing arenas. Because of the relatively small number of hours required for the major, it is strongly recommended that the student pursue an additional major, or a strategic set of additional minors, that the Writing major will complement.

The student must earn a minimum of 35 hours from among the following requirements and options:

18-25 credit hours from the following courses devoted to writing, editing, and/or publishing:

ENGL 2500, Appreciation of the Writing Craft, 2 credit hours ENGL 2510, Creative Writing Workshop, 1 credit hour ENGL 2580, Spiritual Practice of Writing, 3 credit hours ENGL 3000, English Grammar and Style, 3 credit hours ENGL 3110, Creative Writing: Fiction, 3 credit hours ENGL 3120, Creative Writing:  Poetry, 3 credit hours ENGL 3140, Writing and Digital Media, 3 credit hours ENGL 3160, Professional Writing and Editing, 3 credit hours ENGL 3180, Composing Nonfiction, 3 credit hours

## Practicum (up to three credit hours) from:

ENGL 3870: Literary Arts Practicum, 1 credit hour

ENGL 3880: Writing Tutoring Practicum, 1 credit hour

- 3-8 credit hours from any other ENGL course level 2000 or higher (not listed above).
- 1-3 credit hours of Writing Internship Experience (required of all writing majors and must be approved in advance by the department chair).
- ENGL 4910: Senior Capstone, 3 credit hours, required of all Writing Majors.

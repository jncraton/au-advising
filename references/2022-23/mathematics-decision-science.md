## Mathematics -Decision Science Major (53 credit hours)                                                          \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Decision science is a discipline that is concerned with using mathematics to make appropriate decisions when confronted with complex problems.   It can deal with optimizing the design or operation of systems involving machinery, materials, money and even people.

The Mathematics-Decision Science major allows students to enhance a Mathematics major with courses from the Falls School of Business, without requiring a double major.  The resulting major is more focused than a traditional Mathematics major, yet still versatile for a broad range of career paths fields throughout business, industry, and government.

## Major Requirements:

- MATH 2010, Calculus I, 4 credit hours (semester 1 of freshmen year)
- MATH 2020, Calculus II, 4 credit hours (semester 2 of freshmen year)
- MATH 2120 , Introductory Statistics with Applications, 4 credit hours

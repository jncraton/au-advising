The political science major is designed to transform students with an interest in or concern for politics into graduates who can understand, evaluate, manage, and shape political events and governmental actions in a manner consistent with a Christian faith perspective. The political science program involves the systematic study of how political institutions influence the behavior of citizens, leaders, and international actors to achieve public policies that promote justice both nationally and globally. Our program will help you prepare for successful careers in government, politics, law, non-profits, teaching, journalism, business, and more.

Note: ENGL 3000 and 3050 may also be applied to the major as elective hours.  Additionally, because the English major is drawn largely from literature classes, the department strongly recommends adding a Writing minor (15 hours) to increase one's competency in writing.  According to university curricular rules, the English major and minor can share only three hours of courses in common.

Up to 3 hours of internship experience may be applied toward the major.  Must be approved in advance by the department chair.

The Department of English offers excellent preparation for students interested in English for the sake of general humanities or as a tool for pre-professional preparation. Introductory courses develop necessary skills for critical reading, analytical thinking, and literary interpretation. Literature courses-with a balance of American, British, and world offeringsdevelop a dialogue between the past and present across political, cultural, and ideological barriers. Literature, as it reflects human activity, helps us understand human values, motives, ourselves and society.

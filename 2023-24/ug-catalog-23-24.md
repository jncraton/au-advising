## Letter from the President

This is where your college experience begins. Before you move onto the Anderson University campus, you plan a course for your first academic year. You sit down with one of our faculty advisors, and you start your story.

My own Anderson University story started in the 1970s. I came with a single focus - myself. What happened during the next four years transformed my life. My vision broadened as I aligned the focus of my life with God's expectations for me: To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with God (Micah 6:8).

Each academic program offered in this catalog was designed by a remarkable group of faculty who bring exceptional skills and knowledge to the classroom. Each course is a building block that fulfills our mission to educate students for lives of faith and service in the church and society. By choosing a liberal arts institution, you see value in developing not only as a professional but also as a person. Our faculty and staff are committed to mentoring you and sharing in those experiences with you as well, beginning friendships that will last long past graduation.

The Anderson University community is based on the core values of integrity, excellence, servant leadership, responsibility, and generosity. We hope you will be able to experience those core values in every aspect of your life at AU. I encourage you to be open to God's leading in your life at Anderson University, for He knows the plans He has for you! We look forward to journeying with you.

John S. Pistole , JD (BA '78)

President

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Anderson University was founded and is supported by the Church of God, with headquarters in Anderson, Ind.  Founded in 1917, the school was a major step in the life of a young and vigorous fellowship of Christians originating about 1880. This fellowship, which took on a common New Testament name, often describes itself as a reformation movement. Its vision was to preach and live out a message of holiness and to invite believers into a body united by a common experience in the saving grace of Jesus Christ.

The message of the church was firmly planted in the mainstream of Christian theology. The quest of this young movement was freedom from what it saw as artificial limitations of church structures and authoritative systems so that the essence of Christian truth might be realized again in freshness and wholeness. The spirit of the movement was one of freedom and joy proclaimed in one early song of the church, 'The Bible is our rule of faith and Christ alone is Lord.' Out of this history, a free and open tradition has provided a supportive context for the contemporary mission of Christian higher education.

The early witness of the church was through the publishing of inspirational material, songs, books, and a paper known as the Gospel Trumpet. Those who were committed to the publishing work and to the evangelistic work of the church recognized the need to train leaders and workers to take their places in the life of the church. An educational department of the publishing house was started and soon became known as the Anderson Bible Training School. The young school moved rapidly to develop a wider general education program, changing its name to Anderson College and Theological Seminary, then to Anderson College, and finally, to Anderson University.

Anderson University has grown to comprise an undergraduate liberal arts program organized into four colleges, including a graduate seminary. The university offers several graduate degree programs, including the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Organizational Leadership (MOL), Master of Music Education (MME), Master of Divinity (MDiv), Master of Arts in Christian Ministry (MACM), and a Master of Theological Studies (MTS).

More than 1,400 students and 300 instructional and professional staff make up the academic community. The university is governed by a board of trustees ratified by the General Assembly of the Church of God, administered by a president and other officers, and staffed by individuals dedicated to the mission of Christian higher education.

## MISSION

The mission of Anderson University is to educate for a life of faith and service in the church and society.

## General Information

## LIVING THE MISSION

We offer quality programs that enable each member of the university to become stronger in body, mind, and spirit; to experience what it means to love God and neighbor; and to adopt Christ-like servant ways in all of life.

Approved by the Anderson University Board of Trustees, 2007

## ETHOS STATEMENT

## Preamble

Anderson University is committed to the preservation of integrity with our past and our present and to ensuring that important values are continued into our future. We want to state clearly to the various constituents we serve - prospective and current students and their families, alumni, donors, the Church, community partners, and prospective and current faculty and staff - the ideals that bind us together as an academic community. This statement articulates our unifying ethos.

## At Our Core

As a learning community, rooted in the Church of God (Anderson) movement, we celebrate the vibrancy of life in Christ. Our identity as a Christian University can be described in three words: Real life transformed. What that means is simple: we want to meet people where they are. We believe that the experiences and beliefs we bring to campus are real and authentic. We choose to welcome those who do not enjoy a relationship with Jesus Christ, and we open ourselves to engaging with people, from all walks of life, in a community and culture confidently faithful to biblical truths and expectations. Our commitment begins with respecting the real lives students bring with them to campus, but it does not end there. We want our entire learning community to experience the kind of genuine transformation that comes from knowing Jesus, and understanding his incredible plans for the world. And so we challenge ourselves to consider three big questions: 'Who is God?', 'Who am I?' , and 'How do we live?' We believe that the pursuit of answers to these questions will lead to genuine Christian spiritual transformation - in and beyond the classroom. Real life transformed for dynamic service to church and society.

## CORE VALUES

We aspire to be a transformative Christian community informed by these core values:

- Servant Leadership - dedication to a life of service; a preferential awareness of the needs of others in the resolution of problems; a willingness to take the first step, however challenging, in meeting the demands of the day; embracing a spirit of servanthood that extends beyond one's culture.
- Excellence - high-quality performance, innovation, and creativity; a relentless pursuit of the best in each individual and the wider learning community.
- Integrity - commitment to Christian moral values, shared virtues, and biblical truth; keeping faith with university policies.
- Responsibility - personal and social accountability to God and neighbor; trustworthy stewardship of personal and university resources.
- Generosity - readiness to give of one's gifts and talents with a spirit of gratitude; an attitude and posture of hospitality that comes with intercultural humility; a willingness to extend others the benefit of the doubt, placing mercy above rightness.

## COMMITMENT TO ACADEMIC INQUIRY

As a church-related comprehensive institution of higher learning, Anderson University exists to assist students in their quest not only for relevant knowledge, meaningful relationships, and useful skills, but also for maturity in self-understanding, personal values, and religious faith. Its curricular design and community life seek to unite the objectivity and rigor of academic inquiry with a sense of perspective and mission emerging from biblical revelation. Charles Wesley's concern is crucial: 'Unite the pair so long disjoined - knowledge and vital piety.'

Anderson University seeks to highlight the freedom of the mind through inquiry, to emphasize the importance of individual worth and personal faith, and to foster the achievement of true community through shared experience and commitment as modeled in Jesus Christ, the servant. Specifically, Anderson University seeks to provide a superior education. As an institution centered in the liberal arts, Anderson University is dedicated to cultivating in each individual an awareness of the physical world, a sense of history, an appreciation of culture, spiritual maturity, a global perspective, social conscience, and an interest in the worth of ideas regardless of their immediate utility.

In addition, the university seeks to prepare thoughtful Christian leaders who are able to enter and compete successfully in graduate schools or the professional fields of their choice. Professional preparation and the liberal arts are not held as antithetical. To the contrary, the aspiration is to bring together the liberal arts, professional preparation, and biblical faith and understanding.

The university community holds a Christian faith perspective and is prepared to raise questions of truth, value, meaning, and morality. It is not hampered by anti-religious bias, nor does it wish to be guilty of unexamined religious conformity. It lives in an atmosphere of free inquiry, even while it affirms that all knowledge is understood most fully in the light of God's redemptive activity in Jesus Christ as that is interpreted through the historic witness of the Bible and the contemporary ministry of the Holy Spirit.

## INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT

Credits earned through educational institutions located outside of the United States will be considered for acceptance after an appropriate evaluation. Educational institutions must be recognized by the Ministry of Education (or other accrediting body) of the respective country in order for credit to be accepted. Students may be required to send their documents to an evaluation agency for a course-by-course evaluation report. An official copy of this report should be sent directly to the Anderson University Registrar. This report will then be reviewed to determine acceptable transfer credit.

## TRANSFER STUDENTS

Anderson University welcomes applications from transfer students. The same admission requirements are expected as for freshman applicants with the following exceptions:

- Applicants who have earned a minimum of 12 college credits after high school graduation with a 2.0 GPA are required to be considered for admission as a transfer student.  If less than 12 earned credits, a high school transcript, showing proof of graduation (or GED) is required and the student must meet the above guidelines for freshman admission.
- Applicants with 12 college credits earned below a 2.0 GPA will be considered for admission by committee. If the committee concludes that the student is admissible they the student will be admitted on probation and limited to enrolling in 12 credit hours per semester for one semester of until a 2.0 GPA is achieved at Anderson University
- Transcripts from ALL post-secondary institutions attended must be submitted, regardless of whether credits were earned or if the student withdrew prior to credit being awarded.
- Official transcripts are those that are received by Anderson University directly from the institution(s) awarding the original credit. Official transcripts are used for admissions purposes only and are not returnable or transferable.
- Official transcripts will be evaluated for credit transfer upon receipt. Courses earning a C- or better from Regionally Accredited institutions will be evaluated for credit by Anderson University Registrar's Office. Anderson University is part of the Core Transfer Library for students to do a preliminary self-assessment of transferable credits.
- The admissions committee reserves the right to conditionally admit students transferring with GPAs below 2.00 on academic probation with a limit of 12 hours per semester for one semester or until a 2.00 GPA is achieved. These students would be assigned to an Academic Coach upon matriculation to the university.
- A transfer recommendation form may be required by the Director of Admission and Dean of Students from the last university attended.
- Conditional Admission: For transfer students who left previous school on academic probation.

## READMISSION

Students planning to return to Anderson University after an absence must complete a readmission form, which can be obtained online at anderson.edu/admissions .

- Official transcripts of all college work taken since the last date of attendance at Anderson University must be submitted.
- All students applying for readmission must be approved by a committee process before readmission can be granted.

## FELONIES

Anderson University is committed to creating a safe learning environment. In addition to complying with federal safety requirements, the University requires all applicants who have been convicted of a felony or has a pending felony charge to disclose this information. The University requires students who have been charged with or convicted of a felony after being admitted to report immediately that felony charge or conviction to the Office of Admission or the Center for Student Life Office. The University will review information on applicants with felony convictions or pending charges and make a recommendation to the appropriate office regarding suitability of enrollment.

## APPEALING THE ADMISSION DECISION

Any student who is denied admission or readmission, or is granted a conditional admission or readmission, may appeal that decision by filing a written request for review. The student should include with that request any additional supporting information not previously available, particularly information of an academic nature. Admissions appeals should be submitted to the Director of Admission for review by the Admissions Committee. No appeals will be processed or granted after the first day of classes.

## ENROLLMENT DEPOSIT

Anderson University requires a $200 enrollment deposit from students planning to attend AU. The full, one-time, $200 enrollment deposit is applied directly to the student's university student account toward the cost of tuition. National Decision Day for colleges and universities is May 1 each year. The Anderson University enrollment deposit is fully refundable until May 1. Anderson University understands that some students and their families may be facing financial challenges and paying a $200 enrollment deposit may not be possible. Students may apply for a deposit waiver by contacting their admission counselor.

## MARKETING, RECRUITING, AND ADVERTISING

As a member of the National Association for College Admission Counselors (NACAC), Anderson University follows the NACAC Code of Ethics and Professional Practices in the recruitment of all students. The NACAC Code of Ethics and Professional Practices is located HERE .

In addition to NACAC's Code of Ethics and Professional Practices, Anderson University will ensure compliance with program integrity requirements consistent with the regulations issued by the Department of Education (34 C.F.R 668.71-668.75 and 668.14) related to restrictions on misrepresentation, recruitment, and payment of incentive compensation. This applies to the educational institution itself and its agents including third party lead generators, marketing firms, or companies that own or operate the educational institutions. As part of efforts to eliminate unfair, deceptive, and abusive marketing aimed at service members.

AU and its agents including third party lead generators, marketing firms, or companies that own or operate the educational institutions will:

1. Ban inducements, including any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, transportation, lodging, meals, or other item having a monetary value of more than a de minimis amount, to any individual or entity, or its agents including third party lead generators or marketing firms other than salaries paid to employees or fees paid to contractors in conformity with all applicable laws for the purpose of securing enrollments of Service members or obtaining access to TA funds. Educational institution sponsored scholarships or grants and tuition reductions available to military students are permissible, and;
2. Refrain from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or federal financial aid (including TA funds) to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting, admission activities, or making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance, and;
3. Refrain from high-pressure recruitment tactics such as making multiple unsolicited contacts (3 or more), including contacts by phone, email, or in-person, and engaging in same-day recruitment and registration for the purpose of securing Service member enrollments.

(Updated 11/29/22)

## FEES

All students have the benefit of a scholarship since they do not pay the full cost of their education. The Church of God, alumni, businesses, industries, foundations, and private donors contribute substantially to underwrite the education cost of each student attending Anderson University.

The following charges are the basic budget costs per semester for the 2023-24 academic year:

| Tuition   | $17,295   |
|-----------|-----------|
| Room      | 3,310     |
| Meal Plan | 2,510     |
| Fees      | 525       |
| Total     | $23,640   |

This budget provides admission as a full-time student enrolled for 12-18 hours. Students are also responsible for field trip costs. Room rent is based on two people per room in most regular university residence halls. Residential freshmen, sophomores, and juniors are required to purchase a meal plan.

The university meal plan offers students various dining options around campus, including the Marketplace (main cafeteria), Raven's Haven (Chick-fil-A and The Nest Express - a virtual kitchen concept for students to mobile order their meals for quick pick-up.), Mocha Joe's (student-run coffee venue), and Create (grab and go). Menu selection and hours of service vary to accommodate students' needs and schedules.

In addition to these basic costs, students should budget $2,500-$3,000 each semester for books, additional meals, and incidental expenses. Rates stated above are subject to change.

Although all tuition, room, and board charges are due and can be paid at the beginning of each semester, a monthly payment plan is available. Information regarding the payment plan is sent to all new and returning students. Payment plan information is available in the Business Office.

Special fees and other rates may be found on the university website.

## FINANCIAL AID

Anderson University seeks to provide financial counseling and assistance to all students desiring such services. A number of aids and resources are available to the university to assist the varied financial needs of Anderson University students.

Most aid at Anderson University is based on financial need. Financial need can be defined as the difference between the cost of education and the anticipated financial contribution from the family toward college costs. Anderson University believes the basic responsibility of educational financing rests with students and their families.

Financial aid is offered to Anderson University students through a combination of aid programs available from federal, state, and local sources. This combination of sources is referred to as a financial aid package. The financial aid package is generally offered with two components of aid: non-repayable assistance (grants or scholarships) and self-help assistance (student loans and employment).

To be considered for need-based financial assistance, students must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Financial aid is awarded annually; Dec. 1 is the preferred date for receiving the FAFSA. Aid requests are considered after March 1 and throughout the school year from the available funds remaining after the preference date.

Occasionally, students may find it necessary to vary their enrollment status (i.e., changing from full time to part time). Because eligibility to the financial aid programs is related directly to enrollment status, students should consult with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships to learn what effect, if any, their contemplated change of enrollment will have on their financial aid.

Additional policies and procedures are available from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships or online at anderson.edu/financial-aid .

## VETERANS BENEFITS

Anderson University attempts to make a good-faith effort to comply with Executive Order 13607: establishing principles of excellence for educational institutions serving service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members. These principles were established to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and accountability of education programs and to ensure all service members, veterans, and their families have the necessary information they need to make informed decisions concerning their educational goals. In addition, we advise service members to speak with an education services officer or counselor within their military service prior to enrolling at the university.

Anderson University complies with regulations of the State of Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Educational Unit, including approval of the university calendar, tuition and fees schedule, and the academic policies of the university. The university is authorized to enroll recipients of the Veterans Administration Educational benefits in regularly scheduled credit courses leading to standard college degrees.

Inquiries concerning eligibility should be directed to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Individuals planning to study under one of the education chapters should receive approval before enrolling. More information is available online at anderson.edu/registrar/veterans .

VA Chapter 31 and Chapter 33 - Assessment of Late Fees.  In accordance with Title 38 US Code 3679 (e), Anderson University adopts the following provisions for any students using U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Ch. 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation &amp; Employment (Ch. 31) benefits, while payment to the institution is pending from the VA. Anderson University will not:

- Prevent the student's enrollment;
- Assess a late penalty fee to the student;
- Require the student to secure alternative or additional funding;
- Deny the student access to any resources (access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities) available to other students who have satisfied their tuition and fee bills to the institution.

However, to qualify for this provision, such students are required to:

- Produce the VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) or Change of Program or Place of Training Form 22-1905.
- All students must submit a VA Education Benefit Request Form for each semester they intend to receive VA payments. Students' classes won't be certified to the VA unless they are enrolled in the classes.

Students who have questions about Veteran Affairs (VA) benefits prior to admission should address inquiries to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs at (888) 442-4551 or www.va.gov/education . Students who have questions about VA benefits after admission should address inquiries to the Office of the University Registrar or the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships.

## REFUND POLICY

Students withdrawing from all classes after classes have begun or reducing the number of hours carried may be entitled to a reduction in charges for tuition, housing and meals. Reductions for withdrawals or schedule revisions occurring on or before the end of:

- first week of classes - 90% reduction
- second week of classes - 80% reduction
- third week of classes - 60% reduction
- fourth week of classes - 40% reduction
- fifth week of classes - 20% reduction
- sixth week of classes - no reduction

Adjustments are based upon the date of official withdrawal. Official withdrawal from all classes must be requested by completing and submitting a Withdrawal/Not Returning form.

Reductions are based on charges made to students and not the amount paid on the students' accounts. There is no reduction of any charges for students who have been dismissed or suspended for disciplinary reasons. Proportional adjustments may be made for summer sessions and those classes where the start dates are not part of the standard term dates.

Questions concerning the policy for complete withdrawal should be directed to the dean of students. Questions of adjustment for reducing the number of hours should be directed to the Office of the University Registrar.

## Academic Policies

## ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS

The Academic Forgiveness Policy extends to a student who has been away from Anderson University for a period of at least five years and was not making satisfactory academic progress, meaning an overall GPA of less than 2.0. This is a one-time opportunity to establish a new GPA.

The policy will not apply if a student has earned a degree, diploma, or certificate from another college or university. A student receiving academic forgiveness is not eligible for graduation honors. The student must not have been enrolled in any coursework for credit at Anderson for a minimum of five consecutive years prior to the point of requesting academic forgiveness. Students who earn grades of C-, D, F, or WF may request up to 15-semester credits.

Upon readmission to AU, the student must demonstrate academic ability by successfully completing 12 semester credits at the university, with no grades below a C. Students who meet these two conditions may petition in writing to the university registrar by completing an academic forgiveness application to have their grades forgiven and not computed in the grade point average and have the words 'academic forgiveness' annotated on their record.

Once the application for academic forgiveness has been approved and after consultation with the student, the Office of the University Registrar will make the following adjustments to the student's transcript: Up to 15 semester credits of coursework, to be selected by the student, will be rescinded prior to the point of academic forgiveness; however, course titles and grades from these courses will remain on the transcript. Calculation of the student's GPA will not include grades for classes approved for forgiveness. For more information, contact the Office of the University Registrar.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Anderson University supports and promotes academic honesty and personal integrity and regards cheating, plagiarism, and all other forms of academic dishonesty as serious offenses against the university community. The Policy on Academic Integrity may be found in full in the Faculty Handbook (Section 4.23) and is also referenced in the Student Handbook available online at anderson.edu/student-life/handbook .

## ACADEMIC LEAVE OF ABSENCE

Anderson University offers undergraduate students who are in good standing, as defined by Anderson University's academic policy, and who are not subject to disciplinary action the opportunity to request an academic leave of absence.

The Leave of Absence Policy applies to students who are pursuing a degree from Anderson University but leave the university for a semester to participate in a study-abroad program, internship, or practicum, which is not done with an AU matriculation. The leave of absence may also apply to students who, due to circumstances beyond their control (such as the need to care for ill parents or the onset of a personal illness or military training), must suspend their enrollment in classes for a semester. A leave of absence may be granted for one semester but, depending on the specific circumstances, may be granted for a full academic year if the student intends to return to Anderson University for the completion of their degree. To qualify, students must be in good academic and financial standing and must complete the required application forms.

The academic records of students granted a leave of absence remain in an active status. While on academic leave of absence, the student retains the right to use some campus facilities such as the AU library, student counseling services, and career services.

Due to Visa restrictions, international students are not eligible for academic leave and should consult with their Designated School Official (DSO). For more information, contact the Center for Student Life.

## ACADEMIC LOAD

A full-time academic load is 12-18 hours. Upon approval from their college dean, students with records of above-average academic performance may register at additional cost for additional hours. Summer school terms, international opportunity, or transfer work may not be used to establish a semester GPA.

The number of hours taken each semester is dependent upon a student's GPA:

- Students with a 3.25 GPA may register for 19 hours.
- Students with a 3.5 GPA may register for 20 hours.
- Students with a 3.75 GPA may register for 21 hours.

These guidelines also apply to students who have earned 52 or more hours and whose cumulative GPAs at the time of registration meet the stated standards. The factors of previous academic achievement, types of courses to be taken, and demands of employment must also be recognized.

## ACADEMIC NOTICE

Students may be dropped from the university at any time when excessive class absences or academic performance indicates an inability or unwillingness to achieve normal progress toward a degree. Typically, however, students not in good academic standing are placed on academic notice for a maximum of two consecutive semesters.

In general, students on academic notice may not participate in any extracurricular activities. The provost has the final authority over the conditions placed upon students on academic notice.

Before attending classes, students on academic notice are expected to sign an academic support contract with the director of educational support services. The contract may include, but is not limited to, such items as study assistance; limits on work commitments, housing, course load; being assigned to LART 1000; and class attendance.

## ACADEMIC PROGRESSION

Any student not achieving acceptable standards may be barred from returning to Anderson University for a period of at least one semester. Students who are readmitted after having been barred once are expected to attain a 2.0 current GPA in their next 12 hours and must continue to achieve or make substantial progress toward the stated minimum standards in order to continue. Readmitted students come in under academic notice status.  If the student is barred a second time, it will be for at least two years. Any subsequent readmission will be regarded as a final opportunity to continue studies at Anderson University.

The provost may request the academic review committee to review and make recommendations regarding cases when necessary. Extenuating circumstances may justify the continuation of students whose cumulative GPA falls below the stated standards.

## ACADEMIC STANDING

To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain the following standards:

| Hours Earned   |   GPA |
|----------------|-------|
| 1-29           |   1.6 |
| 30-59          |   1.8 |
| 60 or more     |   2   |

## ADVANCED PLACEMENT

Advanced placement and/or credit may be earned through placement examination for a maximum of 30 credits. The four examinations Anderson University recognizes are the Advanced Placement Program (AP) of the College Board, the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), the Cambridge International Examinations (GCE A level), and the International Baccalaureate Program, subject to approval by the academic departments. Credit received by examination is tuition-free and applies toward the requirements for graduation.  For more information, consult the university website at anderson.edu/registrar for the most current and updated information.

## AUDITING A COURSE

As a means of enrichment to the degree-seeking student, Anderson University recognizes the following ways of auditing a course:

1. Occasional class visitation: A student may wish to visit a class to hear a lecture and/or a discussion on a given topic. The instructor's consent is the only necessary requirement.
2.  Auditing one course without fee: Any student registered for 12-18 hours who is making satisfactory academic progress may enroll in an additional class on an informal audit or recorded audit basis.

- A. Informal Audit: Infrequent attendance of a class with no course obligation. Although formal registration is not required, the student must have the written consent of the instructor. Permission forms are available in the Office of the University Registrar. No record is made of the audit on the student's permanent record.
- B. Recorded Audit: Regular attendance with normal course obligations for the purpose of having the audit recorded on the student's permanent record. In this situation, the student should follow these procedures:
- i. Register as an audit using the schedule of classes form or change of schedule form, signed by the advisor.
- ii. Adhere to the instructor's stated attendance policies.
- iii. Complete sufficient work of C- quality or better in order to have the audit recorded.
- iv. Changes of schedules to or from an audit must be done no later than the end of the 5th week of the semester.

The course will be recorded on the student's permanent record as an audit if the above conditions are met and the student does satisfactory work in the course. If the above conditions are not met, the instructor will notify the Office of the University Registrar and no record of the audit will be made.

3.  Auditing with payment of fee: A student who does not meet the specific requirements as outlined above may, upon payment of the audit fee, audit a course as outlined under 'A' or 'B' above. Full-time students are entitled to audit one course per semester at no additional charge. Other students will be charged the current fee.

The courses will appear on the transcript with a grade of "AU" and will not count toward academic credit. Auditing is a policy privilege extended to full- and part-time AU students only.

## CLASS ATTENDANCE

Effective learning in a university requires the active involvement of both students and faculty. Students are expected to attend all classes unless prevented by extenuating circumstances. Inasmuch as students are responsible for the learning that may develop from both in-class and out-of-class experiences, they should anticipate absences for a good cause (such as varsity athletic trips, field trips, music, drama, and debate trips) and advise their instructors of such absences as far in advance as possible.

Any absence from a class results in a loss of learning for the student. It is the student's obligation to personally notify the individual course instructor(s) about any absence, in advance if possible. Students may be directly penalized only after the number of absences exceeds the number of class meeting hours per week. Where a student misses more than the number of classes stated above, the course instructor has the discretion to allow for the completion of missed work and to determine how such work will be evaluated, including possible penalties.

## CLASS LEVEL IDENTIFICATION

Class identification at Anderson University is determined as follows:

- Freshman: A student who has completed fewer than 24 hours of college credit.
- Sophomore: A student who has completed 24-51 hours of college credit.
- Junior: A student who has completed 52-87 hours of college credit.
- Senior: A student who has completed 88 or more hours of college credit.
- Lower-Division: Freshman and sophomore students.
- Upper-Division: Junior and senior students.
- Part-time: A student carrying 1-11 hours.
- Special: Audit, guest student, or high school student. Also includes children or adults who are taking music lessons but are not enrolled in academic work at the university level.

## COURSE REPETITION

Students may repeat courses for which they received a C- or lower by simply re-enrolling in the same institutional courses. If students wish to repeat courses for which the departmental captions or numbers have changed, they must petition the university registrar. Furthermore, students may repeat courses for which they received a C or above by petitioning the dean of the college in which each course is offered to be granted an exception. The following rules apply in all cases:

- Students may repeat any given course a total of only two times during their academic career.
- Withdrawal (W, WF, or AW) grade counts as an attempt, but it does not change the previous grade.
- All previous grades received will remain on students' academic records.
- Only the most recent grade received will be used in calculating GPA.
- Credit hours earned toward graduation will be counted for only the most recent course taken.

This policy does not apply to Anderson University credit by examination or transfer credit. The course repetition policy does not apply to courses taken at other colleges or universities and transferred to Anderson University.

## CREDIT HOUR POLICY

Anderson University's definition of a credit hour formalizes compliance with federal and accreditation expectations and helps to provide consistency throughout the University. In general, academic courses constitute between 35-45 hours of learning engagement for every credit hour earned. For example, one credit is equivalent to 50 minutes (at a minimum) of class time (direct instruction) and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work per week. Therefore, a three-credit course will typically meet 150 minutes per week for 15 weeks (37.50 hours, direct faculty instruction). Credit hour guidelines for various modalities are as follows:

## Classroom Instruction (Face-to-Face)

- Lecture/Seminar : Courses focus on principles, concepts or ideas, lecture, discussion and demonstration. A semester credit hour is earned across 15 weeks for three 50-minute sessions per week or two 75-minute sessions per week of direct faculty instruction with a minimum of two hours of student learning engagement outside of class per week throughout the semester. For example, a typical three-credit hour course meets for three, 50-minute sessions or two, 75-minute sessions a week for fifteen weeks. Most lecture and seminar courses are awarded 3 credits.
- Accelerated : Courses offered within the standard 15-week term but in an accelerated format (e.g. 7 or 8 weeks). The content and substantive learning outcomes are the same. These courses must meet the definition of standard lecture contact time and out of class engaged learning within the time frame the accelerated version is offered.

## Practical Application

- Laboratory : Courses where the major focus is on 'hands on' experience to support student learning (use of equipment, activities, tools, machines generally found in a laboratory). One to two Laboratory credits represents a minimum of 1 hour per week of lecture or discussion plus a minimum of 2-4 hours of scheduled supervised or independent laboratory work.
- Studio : Courses taught as applied study on a private or semi-private basis. Students receive anywhere from one to two credits for applied music courses. Private instruction ranges from 30 to 60 minutes with independent practice as prescribed by the instructor.
- Internship/Field Experience : Courses developed for independent learning and the development and application of job related or practical skills in a particular discipline. These courses allow for observation, participation, and fieldwork, and are generally offered off campus. Internship time includes a combination of supervised time by approved experts outside the university, student assignments, and time supervised by a university instructor.
- Practicum/Student Teaching : Courses developed for independent learning and the development and application of job related or practical skills in a particular discipline. These courses allow for observation, participation, client evaluation, fieldwork, and are offered off campus. Internship time includes a combination of supervised time by approved experts outside the university, student assignments, and time supervised by a university instructor (See above).
- Clinical Placement : Supervised experiences where students are afforded an opportunity to apply skills and techniques acquired from assessment and intervention-oriented course material. Number of hours varies by academic program based on clinical placement site hour requirements and student assignments (See above).

An equivalent amount of work is required in courses and academic activities where direct instruction is not the primary mode of learning, such as independent study, and directed study, online, and hybrid courses. Credits will be awarded on the basis of documented learning objectives, expected learning outcomes, and student workload expectations within a specified period of academically engaged time.

- Independent Study : Courses that permit a student to study a subject or topic in considerable depth beyond the scope of a regular course. Students meet periodically, as agreed upon with the faculty member, for the duration of the course. University faculty provides guidance, critique, and review of the student's work. Students demonstrate competency through the completion of a final assessment either by submitting a final paper, project or portfolio, etc. as required by the faculty member. Credit hours are assigned based on approximately 35-45 hours of learning engagement per credit hour for the amount of activity associated with the course, faculty supervision, and amount of student outside work.
- Directed Study : Courses that are regular courses, not available in the semester and that the student has not been able to schedule in the regular sequence. Scope, assignments, and requirements for a directed study course are the same as for the regular course with the same course number, title, and description. Students meet with the instructor as arranged, completing approximately 35-45 hours of learning engagement per credit hour which may include face-to-face instruction, independent work, online discussion, and written assignments or tests.

- Hybrid : A course is considered hybrid (or blended) when it is composed of both online learning and classroom learning and incorporates the best features of both environments to meet the learning objectives of the course. No less than 51% of the course is to be scheduled as face-to-face, and no more than 49% of the course is to be scheduled as online. For a three-credit course, no less than 76.50 minutes (1.275 hours) a week can be scheduled face-to-face and no more than 73.50 minutes (1.225 hours) per a week can be scheduled online equaling a total of 150 minutes of instruction per week.
- Online (Asynchronous) : Courses where 'instructors and students do not meet in the same space'. Regardless of mode of instruction, courses should be consistent in terms of quality, assessment, learning outcomes, requirements, etc. as courses offered face-to-face with the same department prefix, number, and course title. Faculty must demonstrate active academic engagement through interactive methods, including but not limited to, interactive tutorials, group discussions, virtual study/project groups, discussion boards, chat rooms, etc. Simply logging on, either by faculty or students, does not constitute active student learning. Credit hours assigned to a course delivered online must equal the number of credit hours for the same course delivered face-to-face.

Revised Expanded Policy: March 18, 2019

## DEAN'S LIST

Full-time students (enrolled in 12 or more graded hours) who earn a semester GPA of 3.5 to 3.99 qualify for the Dean's List. Full-time students who earn a perfect 4.0 semester GPA qualify for the Dean's List with the additional honor of 'Special Distinction.'

## GRADING

## Grades, Hours, and Credit Points:

An 'hour' is coursework equivalent to one class hour per week for a semester. A 'credit point' is a measure of the quality of work performed. Credit points are figured only on work completed at Anderson University.

Grade reports are issued by the Office of the University Registrar in the following terms:

| A , A-      | Achievement of superior quality in course objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| NC          | Work completed at an unsatisfactory level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Students may withdraw from courses during the first five weeks without having a notation on their transcripts; they may withdraw with a recorded W after the fifth week but no later than the end of the 10th week. Students may change their registration to or from S/U during the first five weeks of the semester. No withdrawals or changes in registration are permitted after the 10th week.

| Credit points per hour:   | A   | =   |   4.0 |

No credit points are given for courses bearing grades of CR, NC, S, U, F, I, W, WF, or AW. The credit point index is the ratio of the number of credit points earned to the number of hours attempted (excluding CR, NC, S, U, and W). No credit points are issued for transfer courses.

Mid-semester grades are available to all students online. Final semester grades are based on the work of the entire semester, which includes examinations and evaluations throughout the course.

## Grade Point Average:

Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of credit points accumulated in courses for which a grade of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F, or WF has been assigned by the total number of hours attempted in those courses. Courses for which a grade of IP, S, U, CR, NC, W, AW, or NR has been assigned are not included in computing the GPA.

When the course is repeated, only the hours and credit points for the latest grade assigned for that course are counted in the total hours attempted and total credit points. The following example shows how semester GPA and cumulative GPA are calculated:

| Course                  |   Hours Attempted | Grade                     |   Credit Points |
|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| ENGL1110                |              3    | C                         |            6    |

| = SemesterGPA :         |              2.04 | = CumulativeGPA :         |            2.48 |

The GPA is truncated (not rounded). For example, a 2.999 GPA is still a 2.99, NOT a 3.0.

## Grade Appeal:

Students believing there is adequate reason for grade reconsideration should consult the instructor who taught the course. If the question about the grade is not satisfactorily resolved, students should consult the appropriate college dean regarding procedures for further consideration. This procedure must be initiated by students no later than 30 days after grades have been issued.

## Credit/Non-Credit Grading:

Some courses are offered only as credit or non-credit. As such, they appear in the master schedule of classes with a CR/NC registration. The hours taken are credited toward graduation but will not be considered in determining the grade point average (or included in considering eligibility for the Dean's List).

## Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading:

In addition to registering for courses on a regular-grade basis, students also have the option of registering on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) basis.

The S/U option seeks to facilitate intellectual exploration in search of a major, in support of a major, or in pursuit of a personal interest; to offer the flexibility of a grading process which most appropriately relates to the objectives of a particular course; and to provide an opportunity, without grade-point consideration, for students to assess their own interests and abilities. This encourages greater communication between students and faculty concerning the meaning of evaluation. Conditions for taking classes satisfactory/unsatisfactory are as follows:

- Choosing the S/U option is always at the student's discretion.
- S/U options are limited to 12 hours for the student's entire college career and a maximum of 4 hours taken S/U in any one semester.
- Liberal arts courses taken to meet liberal arts requirements may not be taken S/U.
- Courses in the academic major or minor or teacher certification programs may not be taken S/U once the major or minor or program has been declared.
- If a student subsequently elects to major in a discipline in which a course had been graded satisfactory, that course, but no other such courses may be counted toward the major or minor.
- An S signifies a grade of C- or better and U a grade lower than C-.
- Courses taken on the S/U basis will not be considered in determining GPA.

Students should consult their advisors or the chair of the department in which they major regarding the desirability of taking courses S/U. The end of the fifth week is the last day for making a change in registration to or from S/U.

## GRADUATION PROCEDURES

A student's catalog expires 10 years after matriculation. If a catalog has expired, the requirements of the graduation catalog must be met. In matters of course standards, prerequisites, eligibility to continue, and other academic policies, students are subject to the regulations and procedures of the current academic year.

To graduate, students must be in good standing with the university and must have financial arrangements satisfactorily made with the Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships. All incomplete grades must be removed, all institutional examination results recorded, and transfer credits from other institutions must be on file in the Office of the University Registrar. The university reserves the right to remove students from participation in commencement based on academic deficiencies and/or disciplinary actions as defined by the dean of students at any time. Petitions to graduate in absentia must be filed with the university registrar at least three weeks prior to commencement.

An Application for Graduation should be filed with the Office of the University Registrar by the following deadlines to allow sufficient time for processing:

- For December and May graduates, by the last Friday in April.
- For August graduates, by the first Monday in October.

## DIRECTED OR INDEPENDENT STUDY

On occasion a student may need or desire to take a course out of schedule (i.e. Directed Study) or to do individual work on a project or topic (i.e. Independent Study) under the supervision of a faculty member.

Directed Study: When a student is unable to take a required catalog course as regularly scheduled the student may petition to the faculty member to take the course as a Directed Study. The same course objectives are used with the only difference being that the student completes the course independently under the direction of the faculty member.

Independent Study: Students interested in pursuing academic credit for an individually constructed course under the supervision of a faculty member may request to develop an Independent Study syllabus. An Independent Study requires a syllabus/learning contract, mutually constructed by the student and faculty member, and must have permission from the faculty member, department chair, academic advisor, and dean. Students may schedule a maximum of 8 hours of independent study applicable to a major, 4 hours to a minor, and no more than 4 hours in a given semester.

## INSTITUTIONAL EXAM

Anderson University recognizes the need for student advancement according to ability and achievement. Therefore, students who are competent in a given subject by reason of their particular background or experience outside the university classroom may choose to receive credit by institutional examination. Examinations are to be taken prior to enrollment in the next level course. Not all courses, however, are appropriate for credit by institutional examination.

Results from Anderson University institutional examinations are considered for purposes of advanced standing or advanced placement.

Students must earn a grade of C- or above in the Anderson University institutional examinations to receive credit for the courses. Satisfactory-unsatisfactory (S-U) grading option is available as well as regular letter grades. Graduating seniors must have examination results on file in the Office of the University Registrar by April 1 of their graduation year.

## INTERNSHIPS

So as to comply with federal and state regulations and to address concerns for university liability, the University requires students to register for an internship prior to the start of the internship and within university deadlines. Granting credit for internships requires enrollment in the class during the semester/term in which participation in the internship occurs. If an internship extends to more than one semester or term, the student's registration must reflect the credit hours earned each semester or term. This policy satisfies the need to limit university liability and to comply with governmental regulations concerning financial aid.

## LATIN HONORS

Students earning a cumulative GPA of 3.7 or above will graduate cum laude; 3.8 and above, magna cum laude; and 3.9 and above, summa cum laude. Such honors are open only to students who have earned the qualifying GPA with a minimum of 60 hours at Anderson University.

## PROGRAM AND POLICY CHANGES

The schedule of classes for each academic year is published the preceding February. Both the master schedule of classes and this catalog are regarded as official statements of anticipated course offerings. The university reserves the right to change or cancel any course for which enrollment is less than six students or for which satisfactory arrangements cannot be made.

In addition to courses listed in the catalog, departments may offer special seminars or other courses, as the need arises, under the numbers 1600, 2600, 3600, and 4600.

## RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

To earn a degree from Anderson University, students must be in residence at the university for the last 24 hours applicable to the degree. Under some circumstances, and with special permission, a maximum of six hours of the final 24 hours may be taken elsewhere. Contact the Office of the University Registrar for more information.

## TRANSCRIPTS

Students wanting transcripts of their university work must submit a written request to the Office of the University Registrar, giving at least one week's notice. The appropriate fee is to be included with the request. All financial obligations to the university must be arranged to the satisfaction of the Business Office before transcripts will be released. Transcripts may be ordered online at getmytranscript.org .

## TRANSFER OF CREDIT FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS

The Office of the University Registrar will evaluate and determine the applicability of all college credits being transferred from other institutions. Students who transfer a substantial number of hours from other institutions are required to complete at least 50% of their majors, minors, or professional fields at Anderson University. Generally, credit is accepted without condition for courses with a grade of C- or above from traditional institutions holding either a regional or Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Students should consult with the Office of the University Registrar concerning policy on acceptance of credit from non-traditional institutions and institutions not holding regional accreditation.

GPA is figured only on work completed at Anderson University. Grades for courses from other institutions do not transfer in.

All international students seeking to transfer credit to the university from outside the United States are required to provide an official foreign credit evaluation (FCE) in English, including the cumulative grade point average. Anderson University will accept course-by-course foreign credential evaluations (FCE) from any National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) member. The international institution must be recognized by the country's Ministry of Higher Education or equivalent government agency.  Note: All expenses associated with foreign transcript evaluations are the student's responsibility.

Transfer courses may be considered applicable to the liberal arts requirement for advanced writing or speech competency (writing/speaking-intensive) if either the transcript indicates that the course(s) were counted toward the other institution's advanced writing or speaking-intensive requirements which meet or exceed Anderson University requirements (see requirements in the Liberal Arts Program section in this catalog), or the student can produce a syllabus that clearly shows how the course(s) satisfies Anderson University's requirements. No more than 64 semester credit hours earned from an Associate Degree may be applied to any Anderson University baccalaureate degree. The transfer credit process can only be initiated for students who have applied to AU.

For more information, contact the Office of the University Registrar.

## Associate of Arts and Associate of Science Degree Transfer Policy:

Any student transferring to Anderson University from a regionally-accredited or CHEA-recognized college/ university with an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree and has completed at least 24 credits in the Liberal Arts will have satisfied the Anderson University Liberal Arts Core requirements with the noted exceptions of the religion requirements (Biblical Literacy and Christian Ways of Knowing) and the liberal arts requirements that are embedded in the majors (Writing-Intensive, Speaking-Intensive, and Experiential requirements). Associate degree transfer students must complete at least 60 hours at Anderson University and reach 120 credits to graduate. This policy only applies to students who hold an Associate Degree prior to matriculating to Anderson University. For more information, contact the Office of the University Registrar.

## Transfer of Credit - Current Students:

Students currently enrolled at Anderson University should obtain permission from the university registrar to take courses elsewhere if they intend to transfer that coursework to AU. Courses need to be taken at a regionally accredited college or university.

A syllabus or catalog description from the other institution is required to determine the applicability of the intended coursework toward the liberal arts or program requirements. Students who have a declared major need departmental approval as well as approval from the University Registrar for a course to apply to the major or minor.

A final grade of C- or above must be earned in order for transfer credit to be received. Grades for courses taken at other institutions will not appear on your AU transcript, but credit hours may count toward graduation requirements. The Anderson University Course Repetition Policy requires that the same course must be taken at AU to adjust the GPA.

## WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES

## Student-Initiated Withdrawal:

Official withdrawal from all courses must be completed by submission of an online form. The official date of withdrawal will be the date that the student submits the form. In extenuating circumstances, students may initiate complete withdrawal from all courses by phone or letter to the Office of the University Registrar.

Students desiring to drop individual courses may do so through their assigned academic advisors. Students are required to present the Office of the University Registrar with a change-of-schedule form noting the changes and their advisors' signatures.

Questions concerning the policy for complete withdrawal should be directed to the University Registrar. Questions regarding dropping an individual course should be directed to the student's advisor or to the Office of the University Registrar.

## University-Initiated Withdrawal

The university has the authority to withdraw a student from the university and to revoke the student's registration at any time during the academic year. There are two types of university-initiated withdrawals: withdrawn failing (WF) and administrative (AW).

The faculty assigns WF at any time before the 10th week of the semester or by the dean of students whenever it is deemed appropriate. It is assigned either when a student has stopped attending classes without officially withdrawing or when a student is withdrawn for disciplinary reasons. For purposes of grade point average calculation WF is equivalent to F.

A grade of AW is recorded for administrative withdrawals. It is assigned by the administration or the dean of students when circumstances do not warrant a failing grade or whenever it is deemed appropriate. The grade of AW is not computed in the student's grade point average and therefore involves no academic penalty. The registrar must authorize the recording of this grade.

Please contact the Office of the University Registrar for the most up-to-date information. Further academic policy information is also available on the university website.

## STUDENT HANDBOOK

In addition to academic policies, students are expected to follow the campus policies and procedures contained in the Student Handbook which is published annually by the Center for Student Life. The handbook also serves as a resource to connect students to faculty and staff working to help them succeed. Some of the policies included in the student handbook include:

- Chapel Attendance
- Residence Life
- Title IX
- Housing
-  Community Standards

There is also information available in the handbook related to the following:

- Financial Aid
- Student Services
- Police and Security Services

For a full list of Student Life policies, procedures, and resources, please review the student handbook, published online at anderson.edu/student-life/handbook .

## MAJORS AND MINORS

Majors provide the opportunity to take a grouping of courses, usually concentrated in one department, for purposes of specialization or professional certification. In addition to the major, a minor or cognate of 15-18 hours may be selected but is not required.

Students are responsible for planning and completing the requirements of their majors, minors, and cognates. A GPA of at least 2.0 is required for all courses applied to the major or area of concentration.

Students completing two or more majors (including complementary majors) must earn a minimum of 15 hours that are unique to each major. To be awarded a major, students must complete at least 50% of all coursework in residence at Anderson University.

## DECLARATION OF MAJOR AND MINOR

Students should file a declaration of major and minor or cognate with Educational Support Services. For planning the proper sequence of courses, students should declare a major as soon as possible.

This application and the procedures involved in its approval afford students an opportunity for evaluation of their objectives in college and life. Students formally state their proposed majors, minors, and/or professional or pre-professional programs and confer with the major advisor of the department or program regarding requirements. This procedure constitutes students' official declarations of majors or minors.

To change majors or minors, students must file the appropriate form with Educational Support Services at the earliest possible date.

## PHYSICAL THERAPY

Anderson University offers a program that prepares students for entry into physical therapy programs. Most students seeking to enter the profession obtain a bachelor's degree in exercise science or biology. Because of the small number of schools offering graduate degrees in physical therapy and the large number of students who apply, admission to those programs is very competitive. Anderson University has developed an articulation agreement with Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri, to facilitate admission for Anderson University graduates to a doctorate degree program in physical therapy. Interested students should contact the Department of Biology for more details and advising.

## PRE-HEALTH PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS

Anderson University offers pre-health professional programs for students desiring careers in medicine, athletic training, physical and occupational therapy, dentistry, physician assistant, pharmacy, chiropractic, optometry, podiatry, and veterinary medicine. Individualized programs are developed for students wishing to enter other health professions not listed above.

Although most pre-health profession students major in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or exercise science, in most cases any major may be chosen as long as the particular health profession program and course requirements are met. The length and specific coursework for each program varies depending on the field and the individual professional school selected.

Each pre-health professional program is designed to give students a broad, Christian, liberal arts preparation for service in the health field of choice. The program usually consists of the following components:

- A standard pre-health profession core of courses (one year each of laboratory-based, college-level general biology, general chemistry, and physics).
- Additional courses in the sciences to increase study skills and knowledge base in the medically related subjects.
- A requirement to include courses in psychology, sociology, biblical studies, and communication as part of the liberal arts component.
- Preparation for the particular health profession standardized exam.
- Being an active member in the Pre-Professional Health Society.
- A committee evaluation and recommendation process for the professional school application procedure.

Students interested in a particular pre-health professional program should contact the director of pre-health professional programs for more information and/or referral to the appropriate advisor in that profession.

The success of Anderson University's pre-health profession programs can be measured in a variety of ways. The university has an excellent placement record during the past 15 years, with approximately 85-90% of students who applied to professional programs having been accepted. Of those students receiving strong committee recommendations, essentially 100% have been accepted. Many of our students during the past 15 years have been in the upper 10% of their professional school classes upon graduation from their respective schools.

## PRE-LAW

Students planning to attend law school are not restricted to any one major. The top majors for students who apply to law school are political science, English, history, psychology, economics, and business. Students are encouraged to work with their major advisor and AU's pre-law advisor to select courses from across the curriculum that prepare them for admission to law school and the practice of law.

Taking classes across the curriculum helps students develop the analytical, writing, research, and oral communication skills necessary to succeed in law school and beyond. These classes also help students acquire the knowledge of history, politics, societies, cultures, economies, and philosophies that make success in law school more likely.

Interested students should consider the minor in legal studies and consult with AU's pre-law advisor as early as possible.

## PRE-SEMINARY STUDIES

The university seeks to serve students preparing for seminary admission through a range of courses considered basic to such graduate professional study. There is no single normative pattern for pre-seminary education because of widely varying emphases and settings for ministry. The Anderson University School of Theology and Christian Ministry follows current admission recommendations of the Association of Theological Schools when it suggests the following categories of learning as foundational for graduate seminary study:

## Pre-Professional Programs

- The ability to read, write, and speak clear and correct English is vital for interpreting and communicating the faith of the church. It is highly desirable that a reading knowledge of Hebrew and/or Greek be developed as a basic tool. Additional language skills might be essential, depending on vocational intent.
- General understanding of human selfhood, modern social institutions, culture and religion, science and technology. Students are expected to have some academic understanding of the fields of philosophy, sociology, psychology, and history, and in some instances, may major in one of these areas.
- Theological understanding of major religious traditions and the contemporary understanding of values and faith. A knowledge of the nature and content of biblical materials is of particular significance.

Details of admission requirements for the Anderson University School of Theology and Christian Ministry should be considered in the planning of undergraduate junior and senior years.

## Liberal Arts Framework

Through the centuries, higher education has attempted to lead the learner toward growth and fulfillment in ways consistent with the assumptions and demands of the times. Standard components of this process evolved and became known as the 'liberal arts.' These areas of study were thought to be freeing and empowering, thus enabling maturity and responsibility in a person's thoughts, values, and actions.

In modern times, such liberal arts studies continue to have fundamental importance, even though their content and design have continued to evolve as societal assumptions and demands have changed. Anderson University stands in this long tradition, designing for all its students a curricular pattern that includes fundamental skills and ways of perceiving the world considered essential for meaningful and effective living in the 21st century.

As a Church of God academic institution, Anderson University is committed to the goals and ideals of liberal education as understood through a Christian faith perspective. The requirements for undergraduate degrees have been established with these commitments in view. The university's conception of liberally educated people involves the freeing and empowering of the total person - his or her spiritual, intellectual, aesthetic, emotional, and physical resources.

## LIBERAL ARTS CORE CURRICULUM

Anderson University has structured its Liberal Arts Core Curriculum to develop students' skills, insight, and appreciation in six Foundational Skills and six Ways of Knowing (40-43 hours).

The combination of these courses presents students with ways of understanding human diversity through the development of intercultural perspectives.

One language course (4 cr.) based on departmental placement; One global/intercultural or additional language course (3 cr.).

- Experiential Ways of Knowing Requirement (built into the major):

Anderson University values experiential learning and requires every major to provide significant experiential learning opportunities for their students. These experiences must intentionally connect academic theory, hands-on practice, and student reflection with a significant academic component.

One experiential competency that can be fulfilled by a course, internship, practicum, capstone, clinical, or approved activity.

Because of the immediate usefulness of writing, oral communication, and mathematics, students should endeavor to complete the written communication (ENGL 1100 or 1110 and 1120), speaking and listening (COMM 1000), and quantitative reasoning requirements during the first college year. Students must enroll in the appropriate writing skills courses every consecutive semester until they have met the writingskills requirement.

The first-year-experience seminar (LART 1050) must be taken within the first 24 credit hours at Anderson University. Students must continue to take LART 1050 as offered until the requirement is met.

In addition, students should endeavor to complete the world language component of the Global and Intercultural Ways of Knowing during the first college year. If necessary, however, the world language component may be completed after the first year, preferably no later than the second year.

The phrase 'upper-division course' means a course numbered 3000 or above. These courses are designed primarily for juniors and seniors and may assume some prior introductory understanding.

For details on how Honors Program (HNRS) courses apply to the liberal arts core curriculum, see the Honors 'Courses of Instruction' section of this catalog.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

Faculty at Anderson University have approved learning outcomes that must be addressed in courses that are approved for inclusion in the liberal arts requirements. These learning outcomes are as follows:

- Critical reasoning/thinking : Opportunities will be provided to develop intellectual curiosity, independence of thought, and an ability to formulate and test positions on major questions.
- Communication : Opportunities will be provided for students to speak and write both within their major fields of study and more general areas with clarity and precision. The experiences will develop an ability to listen and respond effectively to the expression of ideas by others, and they will have the technological and bibliographic skills needed for the development of defensible positions.
- Cross-disciplinary view : Opportunities will be provided for students to develop a variety of perspectives on major issues, events, and questions.
- Christian commitments and practices : Opportunities will be provided for students to explore the relationship between Christian commitments and practices and personal and global questions and issues. They will be encouraged to explore their obligation for service in personal and professional areas of life and have a sensitivity to their relationship to God, the church, and society.
- Intercultural perspectives : Opportunities provided for students to develop an understanding of people from diverse cultural groups, races, genders, socio-economic backgrounds, political opinions, languages, and religious experiences.
- Preparation for service : Opportunities will be provided for students to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required in graduate or professional education or the job market. We consciously bring together the liberal arts, professional preparation, and biblical faith and understanding to assist students to serve in diverse local, national, and global societies.

As an institution committed to Christian service, Anderson University strives through its curricula and informal activities to achieve student development in these areas, providing the breadth and depth necessary for the fullest preparation for life.

## BIOLOGY

Prof. Bailey, Dr. R. Taylor

The Department of Biology provides a quality educational program combining a broad foundational core curriculum with four areas of specialization:

- Pre-Professional : a curriculum designed to enhance the student's appreciation of and success in a professional education program in various medical arts.
- Science Education: a curriculum chosen to prepare students to be at the forefront of science education for the 21st century.
- Molecular/Biochemistry/Microbiology: a curriculum designed to provide the skills, knowledge, and analytic ability to succeed in modern biology research and/or industrial arenas.
- Ecology/Environmental: a curriculum designed to prepare for bachelor entry programs in field biology and environmental science and graduate studies in the fields of ecology, the environment, and zoology.

For those students wanting to go on to graduate school or medical school, the BS is strongly recommended. For more information regarding these programs, contact the department chair or visit the departmental office (Hartung 220).

The ecology/environmental concentration is greatly enhanced through Anderson University's participation in programs offered by the Au Sable Institute of Environmental Studies. The institute has five field stations worldwide: northern Michigan, Puget Sound (Washington), Vara Blanca (Costa Rica), Chicago, and Tamil Nadu (South India). Each station offers field courses (mostly during the summer) in ecology and environmental science appropriate to its location. Students taking courses from Au Sable remain Anderson University students. Since the university has been identified as an institution eligible for financial grants, qualified students may be awarded Au Sable fellowships and scholarships. Interested students should contact Dr. Scott Carr for further application information.

The department undertakes advising and supervision of undergraduate programs in a variety of health and science vocations other than those specifically mentioned above (e.g. pharmacy, physical and occupational therapy, physician's assistant, etc.). These pre-professional programs require completion of two to four years at Anderson University followed by graduate or clinical training at another institution in order to enter the profession or stand for licensure examinations. Biology faculty share advising for these programs and interested students should contact them for additional information.

The Department of Communication and Design Arts is committed to preparing students for an active and faithful life of stewardship within their chosen disciplines. Recognizing the close connection between creativity and the Creator, we seek to do this work with integrity, free and open inquiry, discipline, collaboration, and excellence.

Programs in the Department of Communication and Design Arts enable students to bring to the communication and design professions both breadth and depth, and they provide students with the opportunity to gain knowledge and learn skills and techniques.

The Department offers majors and minors in the following fields of study:

## ● Cinema and Media Arts

The major emphasizes the art of storytelling as the foundation for creating visual media. Instruction in audio, video, and cinema production prepares majors for careers in scriptwriting, production, management, and related areas. Students create and showcase their original work through the Black Bird Media Lab and the Black Bird Film Festival, and they have the opportunity to spend a semester in Hollywood through the CCCU's Los Angeles Film Studies Center.

## ● Communication

An accelerated online program, this major leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree for adults who wish to enhance their communication skills for professional advancement or a new position. The program emphasizes the kind of communication, broadly defined, that's essential for successful organizations. Majors learn how to communicate effectively and strategically as they interface with the various constituencies of a business or non-profit organization.

## ● Multimedia Journalism

Students are prepared for careers in reporting, writing and editing in both the print and electronic media environments. Practical experiences include producing news stories in classes, writing for the professional press, interning at a variety of news organizations, and working on newscast and online content for the student-operated news organization, the Andersonian.

## ● Public Relations

The field of public relations focuses broadly on strategically building and maintaining relationships with the various constituencies that are important to organizations. In the public relations major, students learn foundations, media writing, campaigns, research, ethics, social media, and event planning. Students may choose one of three tracks: public relations, public relations with a concentration in event planning, and public relations with a concentration in social media. This program offers an option to complete the major in three years rather than the traditional four. Classes are complemented by experiential learning through internships and the student-operated PR agency, Fifth Street Communications. The program also houses a chapter of the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA). Public relations majors are required to maintain a PRSSA membership, with dues assessed yearly.

## ● Visual Communication Design

This major prepares students for professional practice through intensive studio, theory, and history studies. A primary focus is the development of a visual portfolio - both print and digital. Courses engage students in the creation of visual products for print, web, and time-based media. Emphasis is on learning how to communicate ideas through appropriately and creatively designed visual products. Professional preparation opportunities include working with clients in studio-based projects and internships at the junior and/or senior levels. Students completing the major are prepared to work in design studios; advertising, marketing, and public relations agencies; corporate and church in-house communications departments; and other professional environments where visual communication is a primary component.

## COMPUTER SCIENCE

## Dr. Preston, chair; Prof. Craton, Prof. Diekhoff

The mission of the Department of Computer Science is to provide students with a strong foundation in the field, build a love for lifelong learning, and ignite a desire to use their skills in service to the church and to society. The Department of Computer Science offers three standard majors - computer science (Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts), data science (Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts), and cybersecurity (Bachelor of Arts), which is an interdisciplinary major offered in conjunction with the security studies program. Also, for students wishing to add a concentration of coursework in these subjects to an existing major, three complementary majors are offered - businessinformation systems, computer science, and data science. The knowledge and skills gained in these majors are uniquely suited to allow our students to be servant leaders in their communities. Anderson University computer science, cybersecurity, and data science students are immersed in project-based experiential learning in both the classroom and the community.

Students develop and apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing on-campus internships with area companies or the Center for Security Studies and Cyber Defense, working with Anderson University Information Technology Services, and working within the Department of Computer Science to install and maintain servers, network, and lab computers. Additional off-campus opportunities include internships with companies in the surrounding counties. Anderson University students in these majors are recognized by employers as having the key abilities necessary in quality employees: integrity, Christ-centered servant leadership, strong written and oral communication skills, problem-solving abilities, excellent computer science skills, and an eagerness to learn what is needed to solve problems.

## COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMS

The curriculum for a bachelor's degree in computer science at Anderson University follows the current Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) curriculum guidelines, incorporates software engineering throughout the curriculum, and provides students with the opportunity to use a wide array of software development technologies. During the freshman and sophomore years, students build the foundation of computer science knowledge while also developing the soft skills that employers value from a liberal arts education. Juniors and seniors focus on applying principles of this foundational knowledge and software engineering to advanced topics, including cybersecurity, computer networks, and operating systems. Teamwork, problem solving, and communication skills (written and oral) are emphasized throughout the program. Projects are oriented toward service to the surrounding community and the university when possible.

A major in computer science allows graduates to pursue jobs in the technology sector, including software development, testing, information technology support, and web development, among many other opportunities. Students who intend to continue their education in graduate school or focus on computationally complex problems in the computer science industry should complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in computer science, which adds foundational courses in math and science as well as requiring an additional computer science course.

A complementary major allows graduates to apply computer science in the specific area of their primary major; nearly any area of study can benefit from the use of computer science principles. The minor in computer science is designed for students who intend to use computer skills within a major to assist in the study of that major. Students are encouraged to speak with computer science faculty when selecting elective credit in order to choose courses that are most applicable to their concentration.

Students majoring in computer science are urged to complete additional coursework in mathematics, accounting, business administration, physics, cybersecurity, or related areas.

## DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS

The curriculum for a Bachelor of Science degree in data science at Anderson University follows the current Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) curriculum guidelines for data science programs. Both the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Arts major in data science prepares graduates to pursue a life of curiosity, exploration, and knowledge creation. Graduates of these programs will have developed an intuition for discovering meaning in data and will have the skills needed to provide value and purpose in almost any field.  The Bachelor of Science data science major prepares students with the advanced mathematical foundations to pursue graduate school or tackle the most challenging problems in industry, while the Bachelor of Arts focuses on the application of the knowledge and techniques of data science to problems in a wide variety of fields.

The complementary major in data science provides students with the foundational understanding to be able to utilize data science techniques and tools within their primary major. The techniques of data science are applicable to a broad range of different domains, so that nearly any major can be enhanced by a complementary major in data science. The minor in data science provides an initial foundation for understanding the functionality of data science tools, and is intended to serve as the first step towards the use of data science techniques in the student's major field of study.

## ENGLISH

## Prof. Beaumont, Prof. Elliott, Dr. C. Miller, Prof. Miller Fox, Dr. Parks

The academic programs hosted by the English department pursue two objectives: to facilitate students' study of literature within the context of the great humanities and to support students' professional preparation.

Courses in the Literary Studies major develop a dialogue between the past and the present across political, cultural, linguistic, and ideological barriers, covering American, British, and global literature. The study of literature, as it reflects human activity, helps us to understand human values, motives, identity, and social structures. Introductory courses develop necessary skills for critical reading, analytical thinking, scholarly research, linguistic study, and literary interpretation.

Courses in the Writing major engage students through advanced training in expository, argumentative, poetic and narrative writing techniques. The department also offers lower-division writing courses to develop basic skill competencies necessary for success in collegelevel work.

Courses in the English Language Arts Teaching major prepare students to teach composition and literature in middle school or high school classrooms. Courses fulfill requirements for content knowledge and meet standards established by state licensing boards and accreditation bodies.

Additionally, the English department hosts minors in Literary Studies, English Studies and Writing, all of which are designed to complement any other major on campus.

## HISTORY

The traditional model of education in history has been to prepare history majors for possible graduate-level work and offering history and education majors the necessary comprehensive understanding of history subjects to pursue careers in education. Such is the model for both lower- and upper-level coursework in history, not only at Anderson University but nearly all liberal arts universities.

This is as it should be, and we certainly do not neglect these goals. However, the history faculty of Anderson University believe it critical for students to think holistically and deliberately integrate into our traditional historical fare broader theoretical issues and life skills particularly communication and critical-thinking skills - that students will find useful and marketable.

Accordingly, our course offerings pursue three primary goals:

- Historical content and critical-thinking skills: The traditional matter of a history course focuses on major events, themes, people, etc. Students will continue to receive a strong and comprehensive education in the bread-and-butter topics that have always defined the history discipline.
- Theoretical content and critical-thinking skills: Particularly in upper-division history courses, the broader themes and issues which are rooted in historical events and issues also focus to speak directly to present as well as past concerns, such as the promise and problems of democracy, the nature of community, global affairs, and the various challenges related to writing and understanding biography.
- Writing and communication skills: Upper-level history courses in particular place an emphasis on developing the student's communication skills but with different variations for each course, such as traditional term papers; a series of brief, shorter papers culminating in a larger project; personal interviews; ethical and professional use of electronic communications such as Twitter; archival research; and/or writing projects pursued in coordination with experiential and technology-driven components.

The history degree prepares students for graduate and law school; careers in public service, museums, archives, and nonprofit associations; education; and many other diverse fields.

Public historians - museum staff and curators, government historians, archivists, historical site interpreters, preservationists - come from a variety of disciplines.

Preparation for work in public history is therefore, and necessarily, interdisciplinary, as it prepares individuals to preserve and transmit our past to the non-academic public.

In the fourth year, they will pursue independent study in partnership with faculty mentors. Throughout the program, honors scholars are encouraged to pursue opportunities for international study and travel and service to the church and community. Upon completion of this four-year program, honors scholars will receive special recognition at commencement and on their transcript.

## MATHEMATICS

## Dr. Lambright, chair; Dr. Coon, Dr. Van Groningen

The program in mathematics has three major objectives: to provide the non-specialist with some understanding of the contributions of mathematics to cultural development; to offer students in natural, social, and behavioral sciences the mathematics necessary for understanding their own fields of interest; and to prepare mathematics majors for graduate study, for teaching at the secondary level, or for work in business and industry.

Students considering careers in mathematics should realize that the emphasis in mathematics courses changes as progress is made through the undergraduate program. The early emphasis on problem solving is later subordinated to the task of formulating and dealing effectively with mathematical structures and abstract ideas.

Students who have pursued accelerated mathematics programs in high school may request advanced placement. Such requests should be made through correspondence with the department chair before registration. Credit, if granted for high school work in calculus or statistics, is through the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Board. Consult with the chair of the Department of Mathematics or the Office of the University Registrar for details.

Students who plan to major in mathematics should consult the chair of the department as soon as possible. Students interested in actuarial science should consider the mathematics-finance major.

A major in Spanish offers students a triple focus: language, culture, and literature. A minor in French Studies, German Studies, or Spanish Studies offers a double focus in language and culture. After successful completion of the program, majors will be equipped to do the following:

- comprehend and interpret written and spoken language;
- express themselves in the written and spoken word of that language;
- have a fundamental understanding of the literature and civilizations of the countries represented by the target language; and
- value other cultures as fellow global citizens.

## NURSING

Prof. Bays, Prof. Gray, Prof. Hofer, Prof. Lopez, Prof. Lutterman, Prof. K. Miller, Dr. O'Keefe, Prof. Sicurella, Prof. Willard, Prof. Wilson

## PROFESSIONAL NURSING

Anderson University offers a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) that emphasizes analytical skills, a liberal arts perspective, and expertise as a baccalaureate generalist. The BSN focuses on developing the student for beginning practice as a member of the profession who is a provider, educator, scholar, designer, manager, and coordinator of care. Students are taught to design innovative nursing care for individuals, families, communities, and populations with complex health states in a variety of health-care settings across the lifespan. The Anderson University School of Nursing conceptual framework borrows elements from the Ecological Model of Health as a way to comprehend the complex interplay between individuals, relationships, and environments.

Upon completion of the first year of prerequisites, students may be eligible for progression to nursing courses beginning in the sophomore year. Supporting and liberal arts courses are taken throughout the four-year curriculum and provide the basis for effective nursing practice and an understanding of the human experience. Transfer credit is evaluated by the university registrar and the dean of the School of Nursing or his/her designate.

All students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better for continuance in the nursing program. To advance, a minimum grade of C must be earned in each nursing class. Students must also demonstrate proficiency in designing nursing care that creates a safe patient environment resulting in high-quality patient outcomes and must receive a satisfactory clinical evaluation to successfully complete any course. Upon graduation, students are eligible to take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). A national NCLEX predictor computerized examination will be given during the second semester of the senior year.

Clinical experiences may include day, evening, and weekend hours. An accumulation of two failures in nursing courses results in dismissal from the program. Students with extended progression times in the nursing major will meet nursing requirements of the class with which they graduate.

The program has received full accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education and approval from the Indiana State Board of Nursing.

For students considering graduate school, the faculty recommends PSYC 2440, Applied Statistics and Introduction to Research, to meet the liberal arts quantitative reasoning requirement.

All who wish to major in nursing must be formally admitted to the School of Nursing. Acceptance to the School of Nursing is on a competitive basis. The requirements are below.

## ADMISSION TO THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING PROGRAM

## PSYCHOLOGY

Dr. Stull, chair; Dr. Blunt, Dr. Griffith, Dr. Priest; Dr. Farmen (emeritus)

Psychology is the scientific study of the brain, mind, and behavior. It is approached from physiological, cognitive, and social perspectives. Psychologists apply the scientific method (including statistics and experimental design) to the study of brain function, perception, memory, development, social influence, attitudes, organizational behavior, abnormal behavior, and the treatment of disorders. This requires the development of skills in critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, speaking, writing, and ethical decision-making.

Each course seeks to integrate psychological theories and data with biblically based principles. Psychology majors have pursued successful careers in research, counseling, teaching, medicine, business, and law. The department's web page can be found at anderson.edu/academics/psychology .

## MISSION STATEMENT

The mission of the Department of Teacher Education is to prepare professional educators of excellence in a Christ-centered environment cultivating excellence in the following areas:

- Content competence
- Cultural connections
- Christian character

In line with the university's mission, the Department of Teacher Education (DTE) seeks to prepare professional educators as teachers of excellence who integrate Christian faith and learning for service in a global society. The teacher education program is anchored in Anderson University's commitment to the liberal arts curriculum, which includes the arts, humanities, mathematics, and social and natural sciences. The liberal arts are essential for developing competent educators.

Education programs at the undergraduate level are based on both established and current research and sound professional practice. The philosophy, objectives, and outcomes for the teacher education program include contributions from the following:

- Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) Standards
- Indiana Content and Developmental Standards for Educators
- International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards
- National and state standards pertaining to each discipline (e.g., CEC, NCSS, NCTM, NCTE, NASM)
- Philosophies and practices of the Department of Teacher Education and faculty in other content areas for licensure
- Collaborative P-12 educators

The Department of Teacher Education offers undergraduate professional education in courses leading to licensure for the elementary, middle, and high school levels. Efforts to renew and improve teacher education by the Indiana Office of Educator Licensing and Development and the national accreditation body, the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), also govern the teacher education program. The Department of Teacher Education received ongoing accreditation by CAEP in 2016, with no areas of improvement cited. Due to these outside influences, regulations and standards governing teacher preparation programs change periodically. The programs of candidates admitted into the teacher education program at Anderson University are subject to those changes. Teacher education candidates are advised to meet regularly with their advisors to assure compliance with new requirements. Due to changing laws and accreditation requirements, there are occasional program policy changes that aren't reflected in the current catalog. See the Teacher Education Handbook for the most recent program guidelines and policies.

## GENERAL INFORMATION FOR ADMISSION/RETENTION IN THE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM

All who wish to major in education and seek licensure must be formally admitted to the teacher preparation program after completing the prerequisite requirements. These requirements must be met prior to enrolling in upper-division education or subject specific methods courses. Transfer students considering a major in education should meet with the Teacher Education Curriculum Director to assess eligibility. Admission to the university neither implies nor guarantees acceptance into the teacher education program.

## Teacher Licensure

Anderson University is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).

- Candidates must have completed or be enrolled in EDUC 2170, EDUC 2860, or MUED 3110.

All fees for tests, background checks, and courses are the responsibility of the candidate.

## Retention in Teacher Education

Candidates admitted to the Teacher Education program are reviewed each semester. Acceptable performance to remain in good standing is defined by:

- Maintaining at least a 2.75 cumulative GPA.
- Earning at least a 2.75 GPA in the content area.
- Completing required testing remediation:
- o Candidates who did not earn a passing score on each of the basic skills exams (reading, writing, math) are required to remediate those skills through the DTE-adopted protocol.
- o Candidates admitted to the program with the GPA exemption must do additional remediation related to their required licensure exams. Those who failed either the reading or writing basic skills exam must remediate on their specific licensure exams. Elementary and math education majors who failed the math basic skills exams must remediate on math-specific licensure exams. Remediation will occur through the DTE-adopted protocols.
- Exhibiting continuous progress toward the knowledge, skills, and dispositions identified in the InTASC standards (e.g., as evaluated by key assessments, field experience evaluations, earning a C or better in all EDUC and SPED courses).
- Adhering to all program, department, and university policies.

Candidates who fail to make adequate progress toward program outcomes (academic and/or dispositional) may be recommended for probation, counseled out of teacher education, or dismissed from the program. Candidates placed on probation will receive documentation that outlines conditions for full reinstatement. Probationary candidates will be permitted to enroll in EDUC and SPED coursework during their probationary term. Probation is limited to one instance of a single semester. If the condition is not removed at the end of the probationary semester, the candidate may be dismissed from the program. Appeals for retention beyond this probationary period must be made in writing to the Dean of the College of Humanities, Education and Behavioral Science and the department chair. Candidates can apply for readmission only once.

## Admission to Student Teaching

Student teaching is the cumulative experience for all education majors. It includes full-time teaching in classrooms of the candidate's licensure area(s). Admission criteria for student teaching include:

- Overall and major GPA of 3.0.
- C or better in EDUC and SPED courses.
- Satisfactory performance on all knowledge, performance, and disposition assessment criteria and any other assessment required by the State of Indiana for licensure.
- Completion of 104 credit hours.
- Satisfactory completion of a student teaching portfolio presentation.
- Successful completion of Indiana content and pedagogy licensure tests by the third Friday of November for spring student teaching and the third Friday of June for fall student teaching. Candidates will not begin student teaching without passing all required Praxis exams (content and pedagogy) or completing the approved remediation plan/course by the testing deadline.
- Completion of a cleared criminal history check, suicide prevention training program, and CPR certification. Both the suicide training program and the CPR certification must meet the requirements of the Indiana Department of Education.

## Educator Disposition Assessment

The DTE expects all teacher candidates in the professional education program to engage in practices and behaviors that are characteristic of developing career teachers. We believe candidates must demonstrate the values, attitudes, and commitments of the developing professional educator. The DTE has adopted the Educator Disposition Assessment instrument to both raise concerns and identify exemplary dispositional behavior of candidates as they progress through the teacher preparation program. Through the use of this curriculum, the DTE informs teacher candidates of the teacher education program's dispositional expectations, assesses baseline dispositional data and documents when changes have occurred in dispositions and under what set of circumstances. Candidates are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the dispositions identified on the EDA in coursework and in the field. When dispositional concerns are identified, candidates are provided additional supports to encourage their professional growth and programmatic success.

## EDUCATION FIELD EXPERIENCES

Teacher education candidates spend extended time working with students, classroom teachers, and university faculty in field experiences early in their major course work and throughout their program. These experiences provide practical application to the theories presented in concurrent education classes. Field experiences are supervised by university personnel. Teacher education candidates are required by AU to obtain a full cleared criminal history check each year before entering the classroom for field experience. Some schools may require their own background check in addition to the one AU requires. This documentation and accompanying fees are the responsibility of the candidate.

## Student Teaching

Teacher education candidates have two options for the student teaching experience: year-long student teaching (approximately 30 weeks) or traditional one semester (approximately 16 weeks). Note: We cannot guarantee the exact number due to the balanced calendar of some districts. The student teaching experience provides candidates with opportunities to plan and implement instruction, manage the classroom, evaluate student progress, communicate with other professionals and parents, and develop as professional educators under the supervision and mentoring of university and P-12 school personnel. Candidates are strongly discouraged from employment on or off campus during their student teaching semester. Candidates must meet all requirements listed above under Admission to Student Teaching. Students are responsible for all fees associated with testing, remediation, and coursework. Due to changing laws and accreditation requirements, there are occasional program policy changes that aren't reflected in the current catalog. See the Student Teaching Handbook for current expectations and policies related to the professional semester.

## EDUCATION TEACHING MAJORS

## Elementary Education - Grades K-6

An elementary education major prepares candidates to teach kindergarten through grade 6. All elementary majors must have a concentration/minor along with their elementary major. The minor does not have to lead to licensing, but the department strongly suggests choosing a minor or concentration that will enhance their major, such as the special education minor (mild intervention).

## ELEMENTARY EDUCATION MAJOR  (83 hrs.)

- EDUC 2000, 2030, 2100, 2110, 2170, 2200, 2460, 2520, 2730, 3120, 3300, 4120, 4310, 4320, 4850, 4910

## READING CONCENTRATION

Embedded in the elementary education major is a reading concentration. All elementary education candidates will earn this concentration and Reading K-6 will be printed on their license in addition to Elementary Education K-6. This does not provide an additional licensing area, but does signify that a candidate has received extra coursework and field experiences in designing effective reading instruction. This may serve as the required concentration/minor for licensing.

## TRANSITION TO TEACHING PROGRAM

## (Post-Baccalaureate Licensure)

The Transition to Teaching Program (T2T), approved by the state of Indiana (IC 20-28-4: 511 IAC 13-1-1), is designed for those individuals with a baccalaureate degree and a desire to become a teacher. This program is specifically designed to recruit, prepare, and license talented individuals for teaching at the elementary (K-6) or secondary (5-12) levels. Admission requirements are established by the State of Indiana. Candidates may select either an elementary or secondary track. Passing all content licensing exams (if not passed at admission), suicide prevention training, and CPR certification required before student teaching. Candidates may retake content exams to earn a higher score. Additionally, admitted candidates may opt to complete a DTE-approved remediation plan/course for content and pedagogy exams in lieu of passing scores. [NOTE: While not required for graduation, passing scores on all licensing exams is required to attain licensure from the state]. The program is subject to any changes from the Indiana Department of Education.

## T2T PROGRAM DESIGN

The Transition to Teaching Program is a 12-month intensive program of educational coursework, field experiences, and a semester of clinical practice (student teaching), which, when successfully completed, leads to a recommendation for an Indiana teaching license. Coursework includes asynchronous and live online instruction. Candidates must be available during the school day from January through May for full-time study and student teaching. Coursework begins in May and is compressed into modules throughout the program.

All courses are in alignment with Indiana Educator Standards (REPA 3 developmental and content standards), Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) Standards, the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) Principles, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards, and the Indiana Office of Educator Licensing and Development.

## ASPIRE ADVISING PROGRAM

Academic advising at Anderson University is integral to 'educating for a life of faith and service in the church and society,' so the advising program is about more than merely selecting classes for an upcoming semester - it also must help students understand and begin to pursue their broader life purpose.

The heart of AU's advising program isn't a checklist or catalog. It's the relationship between the student and his or her advisor. This is a partnership in which both student and advisor have important responsibilities. Advisors can help guide a student's steps, but student success ultimately requires their careful thought and engagement.

The Anderson University advising program has been designed to encourage and empower students to:

- develop awareness of opportunities for academic, personal and professional growth
- design a multi-year strategic plan for selecting classes and complementary on- and off-campus activities and affiliations that enhance their learning experience
- implement their academic program and effectively manage the broader area of personal and professional development
- continually reflect on and evaluate the appropriateness of their current academic and professional-development plan, and modify the plan as goals may change and circumstances require

## STUDENT'S ROLE IN THE ADVISING PROCESS

To get the best results, students should take an active role in the process, keeping the following information in mind when doing scheduling or other progression planning:  Accept responsibility for their academic performance; prepare for each appointment by reviewing progress made, preparing the schedule they think they'll need, and compiling a list of any questions they might have; and to:

- Accept responsibility for deciding which classes to put on their schedule.
- Be attentive to course prerequisites, and be aware of how their planning could be affected by classes that are scheduled on an every-other-year basis.
- Be familiar with AU deadlines, policies and procedures so they can enroll in the classes they want and can make any changes before the deadlines for adding or dropping courses.
- Talk with their advisor about extracurricular activities, internships, job prospects, etc., and develop a list of specific opportunities they might like to pursue.
- Document completion of professional development experiences through their advisor's Canvas advising page.

## ADVISOR'S ROLE IN THE PROCESS

Students may expect their advisor - as their partner in the advising process - to:

- Be approachable, listen carefully to the student's questions and concerns, and be responsive to requests for meetings and assistance.
- Understand and explain how the university's curriculum, requirements, policies and procedures apply to the student's academic program.
- Provide honest guidance and perspective in the development of attainable educational and professional goals.
- Assist in exploring major and career options t in keeping with the student's aptitudes, values and areas of interest.
- Help track student progress in meeting the requirements of their program of study.
- Assist in identifying opportunities for personal growth, including involvement in student organizations, internships and off-campus programs and associations.
- Provide referrals to campus resources (e.g., Center for Career &amp; Calling) that can assist students in achieving goals.
- Maintain strict confidentiality pursuant to FERPA regulations.

## ACADEMIC STUDENT SUCCESS COACHING

Academic coaches  within the office of Educational Support Services  work with students and student athletes who are either at-risk academically or have found themselves on 'Academic Notice' pursuant to the university's academic standards. Coaches meet individually with students, helping them to create a success plan and connecting them with campus resources where they can discover the tools needed in order to be successful.

## Academic Support

## ALPHA PROGRAM

Anderson University believes that all students entering the institution deserve a fair chance to succeed. In turn, success depends on students being adequately prepared to meet the rigors of college-level study. The ALPHA program is designed to support students who have the potential to succeed but have not fully developed the skills necessary for collegiate success.

In considering new student applications, the committee for admissions carefully reviews several sources that serve as indicators of collegiate success. Based on these academic records and recommendations, the admissions committee may accept students conditionally for participation in the ALPHA program. As part of the program, students are expected to participate in a pre-collegiate orientation designed to acclimate students to campus before the beginning of classes. During the fall semester, participants are limited to enrolling in a maximum of 12-15 hours (depending on the major). In addition, these students are required to enroll in LART 1010 (Strategies for Academic Success), a three-credit-hour course focusing on academic, study, and life skills (including Emotional Intelligence skills development) necessary for success in college.

## STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY SERVICES

Anderson University offers learning-support services for all students who qualify under the ADAAA/Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To secure reasonable accommodations, students must notify the appropriate institutional representative of the disability, provide current documentation of the disability, and request the specific accommodations needed. Certain accommodations may require advance notice to the director for student accessibility services.

Documentation/evaluations must be completed by an appropriately trained professional and provide information about the current impact of the disability. Documentation/evaluations should also include recommendations for appropriate accommodations. The institution must be given a reasonable opportunity to evaluate requests. Accommodations are considered based on individual need. Accommodations may be denied in cases that cause an undue burden to the institution or that fundamentally alter the nature of the program.

Students requesting reasonable accommodations or learning-support services should contact Teresa Coplin, director for student accessibility services, Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, (765) 641-4223, tjcoplin@anderson.edu .

## KISSINGER ACADEMIC CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE (KACE)

KACE promotes academic success and excellence by providing a variety of free services for all Anderson University students. The center has individual and group-oriented resources, including self-directed, audio, audio-visual, and computer-assisted instructional support materials. The center focuses on helping all students achieve and/or exceed their academic goals. This assistance may be related to specific courses; to the improvement of abilities such as reading, writing, and specific study skill competencies; and to preparing for special exams, such as the Core and Casa. From peer and online tutoring and study groups for virtually all courses, to general assistance with reading and study skills, the center staff is eager to help students meet their academic goals. In addition, Student Accessibility Services is located within the center.

## Academic Enrichment

CPS Fellows also use the program to develop a public service ethic, increase their awareness of societal needs, and gain firsthand knowledge of their career before graduation. The center's approach is purposely flexible and individualized. Membership in CPS is highly competitive and based on a comprehensive application process. Students of sophomore standing or above with a GPA of at least 3.4 are eligible to apply. For more information, contact CPS at cps@anderson.edu .

## CHICAGO CENTER

Chicago Center semester and summer programs offer the opportunity for students from all majors to live and learn in Chicago while earning credit toward graduation. Three components comprise the program, including an internship in an urban organization, an independent study project that is related to the internship, and a course on urban issues. Students arrange their individualized program in cooperation with the AU campus liaison and Chicago Center staff. While in Chicago, students live and study with individuals from other small Midwest church-affiliated colleges and universities. The campus liaison is a faculty member from the Department of Social Work and Criminal Justice.

## DEPARTMENTAL HONORS

Students also may earn honors in the departments in which they do their major work. A student must attain a 3.0 GPA in all courses, a 3.5 GPA in all courses taken in a department, and must fulfill the specific departmental requirements. Annually, each department may have at least one student receiving departmental honors; the maximum number receiving honors is approximately 10 percent of the graduates in the department. Departmental and institutional honors are open only to students pursuing a bachelor's degree and are awarded after all work for the degree is completed.

## HONOR SOCIETIES

Anderson University has chosen to participate in a number of national academic honor societies. Students whose academic achievement is sufficiently meritorious will be invited to join an honor society (or societies) based on overall GPA and academic major. National academic honor society chapters fostering the pursuit of scholarship at AU include the following:

## HONORS STUDY

Honors study at Anderson University varies by department. In general, such study may take the form of advanced placement, institutional credit by examination, special sections in some courses, certain reading courses, tutorials, seminars, and individual study. In some instances, honors study begins at the freshman and sophomore levels, particularly advanced placement and special sections. Seminars and individual study are usually implemented at the junior and senior levels. Special reading courses and tutorials may be taken at either level.

At any level, the primary purpose of honors study is not acceleration but enrichment in both scope and depth. Students considering honors study should consult their advisors or the University Registrar. For additional information, see also the Honors Program section under Courses of Instruction in this catalog.

## INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS

Anderson University sponsors 20 intercollegiate athletic (10 men's and 10 women's) teams within the mission of the university and the NCAA Division III philosophy. Beyond traditional athletics, Anderson University also maintains an esports team, competing in various games. The athletic program is understood as integral to the academic program, with the primary emphasis on the student-athlete. The department of athletics strives to recruit students who meet the academic standards and value the ethos of the university. For more information, visit athletics.anderson.edu or contact the athletic director.

## SUMMER STUDY

The summer school program offers students the possibility of attaining a full semester's credit by participating throughout the entire summer term in a variety of delivery formats (e.g. face-to-face, blended, or online). Generally, summer classes are offered in either two 8-week sessions or one 16-week session. Also possible during the summer are specially arranged courses such as directed studies, TRI-S Global and study-away programs. These courses are arranged to help students meet educational goals during the summer without requiring an on-campus presence.

The summer school schedule of classes lists course offerings and information about other educational opportunities. A student who wants to enroll in summer classes should contact their academic advisor to determine courses that will fulfill graduation or other requirements. Additionally, the student must meet with their financial aid counselor before registering for summer classes. Students planning coursework elsewhere during the summer should consult the University Registrar.

## TRI-S GLOBAL AND STUDY-AWAY

The TRI-S and Study-Away Office serves as a resource for students interested in study-away, international or intercultural internships, or short-term service/learning experiences (TRI-S). The Tri-S and Study-Away staff maintains and directs a wide range of semester and summer programs focused on developing intercultural competence and assists students in integrating an international or intercultural study experience with their degree program at Anderson University. They also advise students regarding the various aspects of international and intercultural study, including program selection, visas and travel documents, financial aid, safety and security issues, and the transfer of academic credit. Students are encouraged to contact the Tri-S and Study-Away Office early in their degree program when considering international or intercultural study opportunities.

TRI-S (Study, Serve, and Share), short-term study-away opportunities, seeks to expand the college campus into the world and open challenging and stimulating cross-cultural encounters through international and intercultural learning and service opportunities. Nearly 300 individuals annually volunteer to build, repair, paint, teach, counsel, research, sing, or provide nursing services in Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States. These experiences are intensified as students work and/or live with individuals of different cultures. Tri-S programs are offered in the summer, during the international opportunity between semesters, or during spring break week.

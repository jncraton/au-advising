PETE prepares students to teach physical education to grades kindergarten through 12. Students experience a range of activity, pedagogy, and field-based courses to help them acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes to become effective physical educators in public or private schools. Students can take a cluster of health classes to add a health certification to their teaching license. To be eligible for teacher licensure, PETE students complete classes in both physical education and in education, including passing the Praxis exams. Modeling a physically active lifestyle and maintaining high levels of fitness are the marks of a serious PETE major.

Youth Ministries is a stand-alone major that prepares students for ministry to youth, including churchbased youth and children's ministries, youth camps, urban ministries, or other settings. The major is strongly rooted in Bible and ministry courses, which prepares students not only for immediate ministry work, but also for further graduate theological education.

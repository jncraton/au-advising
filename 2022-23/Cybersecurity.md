## Cybersecurity Major (56 credit hours)

The Cybersecurity program is designed for students who seek to defend against cyberthreats in the realms of industry and public service.  Cybersecurity majors seek to be the "good guys", similar to firefighters or policemen, defending individuals, customers, and the public against today's ever present cyberattacks.  Courses acquaint students with information assurance, server and network environments, cryptography, cyber-related public policy, and cyberwarfare.  Majors in Cybersecurity typically pursue careers in industry for a wide variety of companies, in a security operations center, or in local, state, or federal government service.

## Literary Studies Major (35 credit hours)

The Department of English offers excellent preparation for students interested in English for the sake of general humanities or as a tool for pre-professional preparation. Introductory courses develop necessary skills for critical reading, analytical thinking, and literary interpretation. Literature courses-with a balance of American, British, and world offerings-develop a dialogue between the past and present across political, cultural, and ideological barriers. Literature, as it reflects human activity, helps us understand human values, motives, ourselves and society.

## Major Requirements: Literature (18 hours)

- ENGL 2400: Introduction to Literary Studies, 3 credit hours Plus 5 of the following 6 courses:

## Elective Hours (11 hours)

Choose from any 2000-level or higher ENGL course, including ENGL 3870: Literary Arts Practicum (1 hour), ENGL 3880: Writing Tutoring Practicum (1 hour)

## NOTES :

ENGL 1100, 1110, 1120, and 4700 do not apply to the major.

Credit for internship experience (ENGL 4880) of up to 3 hours may be applied toward the major.  Must be approved in advance by the department chair.

The department strongly recommends adding a Writing major (35 hours) or minor (15 hours) to increase one's competency in writing. The Literary Studies major and Writing major must have a minimum of 15 hours that are unique to each; the Literary Studies major and Writing minor may share up to 3 hours in common.

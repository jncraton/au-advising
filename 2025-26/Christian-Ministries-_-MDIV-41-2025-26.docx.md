## Christian Ministries Major to Masters of Divinity, 4+1 Track (46 + 72 credit hours) 144 total            2025-26

The BA/MDiv 4+1 degree program is designed for undergraduate students who are highly motivated academically and sense an early call to ministry. It is designed to enable the student to complete both the BA and Master of Divinity degrees in a seamless 5-year program between Anderson University undergraduate studies and seminary preparation. (Traditionally, completing both the BA and MDiv degrees has taken an average of seven years.)

48 hours of the MDiv requirements apply towards the major and electives in the BA degree requirement of 120 hours (indicated in the 5 year plan in italics). Upon meeting all BA requirements (LACC, Major, and 120 credit hours), the BA is conferred. The remaining 24 hours of MDiv requirements will be required for conferral of the MDiv.

The 4+1 track is also available for students completing a Youth Ministries Major. An advising plan is available for these options upon request.

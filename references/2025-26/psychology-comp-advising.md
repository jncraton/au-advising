Psychology is the study of behavior and mental processes. It crosses many disciplines including biology, sociology and religion. Students select to major or minor in psychology in order to prepare for working with people. By the time they graduate from the program, they will be prepared for graduate work in psychiatric social work, professional training in clinical or counseling psychology, working with families, personnel work in industry, pre-ministry, careers in the not-for-profit sector, working with handicapped individuals, or for careers in teaching and research.

## Mathematics - Finance Major (53 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Mathematics-Finance and Mathematics-Decision Science majors allow students to use courses from the Falls School of Business to enhance the Mathematics major without requiring a double major.  The resulting majors are more focused than a traditional Mathematics major, yet still versatile for a broad range of career paths.

The Mathematics-Finance major would prepare students for careers in areas such as banking, corporate finance, financial planning, financial analysis and actuarial science.  In addition, it would prepare students for graduate study in Mathematical Finance, Applied Mathematics, and Actuarial Science.

- MATH 2010, Calculus I, 4 credit hours (semester 1 of freshmen year)
- MATH 2020, Calculus II, 4 credit hours (semeste r 2 of freshmen year)

## Public History Major (59-60 credit hours)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The public history major and minor prepares students who wish to work in the field of history outside the classroom, in settings where history is encountered by the public: museums, community history centers, national parks and historical sites, and many more settings. Public historians - museum staff and curators, government historians, archivists, historical site interpreters, preservationists - come from a variety of disciplines.

Preparation for work in public history is therefore, and necessarily, interdisciplinary, as it prepares individuals to preserve and transmit our past to the non-academic public.
